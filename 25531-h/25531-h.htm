<h2><a name="CLYDE_FITCH" id="CLYDE_FITCH"></a>CLYDE FITCH</h2>

<p class="center">(1865-1909)</p>


<p>Clyde Fitch brought a vivacity to the American stage that no
other American playwright has thus far succeeded in emulating.
The total impression of his work leads one to believe that he also
brought to the American stage a style which was at the same
time literary and distinctly his own. His personality was interesting
and lovable, quickly responsive to a variety of human
nature. No play of his was ever wholly worthless, because of that
personal equation which lent youth and spontaneity to much of
his dialogue. When he attained popular fame, he threw off his
dramas&mdash;whether original or adapted from the French and
German&mdash;with a rapidity and ease that did much to create a
false impression as to his haste and casualness. But Fitch,
though a nervously quick worker, was never careless. He pondered
his dramas long, he carried his characters in mind for
years, he almost memorized his dialogue before he set it down on
paper. And if he wrote in his little note-books with the same
staccato speed that an artist sketches, it was merely because he
saw the picture vividly, and because the preliminaries had been
done beforehand.</p>

<p>The present Editor was privileged to know Fitch as a friend.
And to be taken into the magic circle was to be given freely of
that personal equation which made his plays so personal. This
association was begun over a negative criticism of a play. An
invitation followed to come and talk it over in his Fortieth Street
study, the same room which&mdash;decorations, furniture, books and
all&mdash;was bequeathed to Amherst College, and practically reproduces
there the Fitchean flavour.</p>

<p>I have seen Clyde Fitch on many diverse occasions. Through
incisive comment on people, contemporary manners, and plays,
which was let drop in conversation, I was able to estimate the
natural tendency of Fitch's mind. His interest was never concerned
solely with dominant characters; he was quick rather to
sense the idiosyncrasies of the average person. His observation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>was caught by the seemingly unimportant, but no less identifying
peculiarities of the middle class. Besides which, his irony was
never more happy than when aimed against that social set which
he knew, and good-humouredly satirized.</p>

<p>To know Clyde Fitch intimately&mdash;no matter for how short a
while&mdash;was to be put in possession of his real self. From early
years, he showed the same tendencies which later developed more
fully, but were not different. Success gave him the money to
gratify his tastes for <i>objets d'art</i>, which he used to calculate closely
to satisfy in the days when "Beau Brummell" and "Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
Lema&icirc;tre" gave hint of his dramatic talent. He was a man of
deep sentiment, shown to his friends by the countless graceful
acts as host, and shown to his players. As soon as a Fitch play
began to be a commodity, coveted by the theatrical manager, he
nearly always had personal control of its production, and could
dictate who should be in his casts. No dramatist has left behind
him more profoundly pleasing memories of artistic association
than Clyde Fitch. The names of his plays form a roster of stage
associations&mdash;the identification of "Beau Brummell" with Richard
Mansfield; of "Nathan Hale" with N. C. Goodwin; of "Barbara
Frietchie" with Julia Marlowe; of "The Climbers" with Amelia
Bingham; of "The Stubbornness of Geraldine" with Mary Mannering;
of "The Truth" and "The Girl With Green Eyes" with
Clara Bloodgood&mdash;to mention a few instances. Those who recall
happy hours spent with Fitch at his country homes&mdash;either at
"Quiet Corner," Greenwich, Connecticut, or at "The Other
House," Katonah, New York, have vivid memory of his pervasive
cordiality. His players, likewise, those whose identifying
talent caught his fancy, had the same care and attention paid
them in his playwriting. Sometimes, it may be, this graciousness
of his made him cut his cloth to suit the figure. "Beau
Brummell" was the very mold and fashion of Mansfield: but that
was <i>Brummell's</i> fault and Mansfield's genius, to which was
added the adaptability of Fitch. But there are no seams or
patches to "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines"&mdash;its freshness
caught the freshness of Ethel Barrymore, and Fitch was confident
of the blend. His eye was unerring as to stage effect, and
he would go to all ends of trouble, partly for sentiment, partly
for accuracy, and always for novelty, to create the desired results.
Did he not, with his own hands, wire the apple-blossoms for the
orchard scene in "Lovers' Lane?" Was he not careful to get the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>right colour for the dawn in "Nathan Hale," and the Southern
evening atmosphere in "Barbara Frietchie?" And in such a play
as "Girls," did he not delight in the accessories, like the clatter
of the steam-pipe radiator, for particular New York environment
which he knew so graphically how to portray?</p>

<p>That was the boy&mdash;the Peter Pan quality&mdash;in Clyde Fitch; it
was not his love for the trivial, for he could be serious in the
midst of it. His temperament in playwriting was as variable as
Spring weather&mdash;it was extravagant in its responsiveness to the
momentary mood. He would suggest a whole play in one
scene; a real flash of philosophy or of psychology would be lost
in the midst of a slight play on words for the sake of a laugh. One
finds that often the case in "A Happy Marriage." He was
never more at home than when squeezing all the human traits
and humour out of a given situation, which was subsidiary to the
plot, yet in atmosphere complete in itself. The <i>Hunter's</i> drawing-room
just after the funeral, in "The Climbers;" the church scene
in "The Moth and the Flame," which for jocularity and small
points is the equal of Langdon Mitchell's wedding scene in "The
New York Idea," though not so sharply incisive in its satire; the
deck on board ship in "The Stubbornness of Geraldine" (so
beautifully burlesqued by Weber and Fields as "The Stickiness of
Gelatine"); and <i>Mr. Roland's</i> rooms in <i>Mrs. Crespigny's</i> flat,
which almost upset, in its humourous bad taste, the tragedy of
"The Truth"&mdash;these are instances of his unusual vein. One finds
it is by these fine points, these obvious clevernesses that Fitch
paved the way to popular success. But there was far more to
him than this&mdash;there was the literary sense which gave one the
feeling of reality in his plays&mdash;not alone because of novelty or
familiarity of scene, but because of the uttered word.</p>

<p>Human foibles and frailties were, therefore, his specialty. Out
of his vast product of playwriting, one remembers stories and
scenes, rather than personages; one recalls characteristics rather
than characters; one treasures quick interplay of words rather
than the close reason for such. Because of that, some are right
in attributing to him a feminine quickness of observation, or
rather a minute observation for the feminine. That is why he
determined, in "The City," to dispel the illusion that he could
not write a man's play, or draw masculine characters. Yet was not
<i>Sam Coast</i>, in "Her Own Way," almost the equal of <i>Georgiana Carley</i>?</p>

<p>I recall, one midnight&mdash;the week before Mr. Fitch sailed on his
last trip to Europe&mdash;he read me "The City," two acts of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
were in their final shape, the third in process of completion.
There used to be a superstition among the managers to the effect
that if you ever wished to consider a play by Fitch, he must
be kept from reading it himself; for if he did, you would accept
it on the spot. All the horror of that powerful arraignment of
city life, and the equally powerful criticism of country life, was
brought out on this evening we were together, and I was able to
see just where, as a stage director, Clyde Fitch must have been
the mainstay at rehearsals. He never lived to give the final
touches to his manuscript of "The City,"&mdash;touches which always
meant so much to him; he was dead by the time rehearsals were
called, and there slipped from the performance some of the
significant atmosphere he described to me.</p>

<p>There comes vividly to my mind his questions after the reading&mdash;trying
out his effects on me, so to speak. Rapidly he reviewed
the work on the third act he had planned for the morrow, consulting
with me as though suddenly I had become a collaborator.
In such a way he must have planned with Mansfield over <i>Brummell</i>;
thus he may have worked with Julia Marlowe, telling her
some of the romantic incidents he had drawn from his mother's
own Maryland love story for "Barbara Frietchie." In the same
na&iuml;ve spirit, he consulted, by letter, with Arthur Byron for his
"stardom" in "Major Andr&eacute;"&mdash;which waned so soon after the
first night.</p>

<p>Everything about the room that evening he read "The City"
bore evidence of the playwright's personality. The paintings
and bric-&agrave;-brac, the books&mdash;mostly biography and letters&mdash;the
tapestries which seemed to blend with the bowls of flowers and
furniture of French design, the windows looking out on lawns,
gardens, and a pond with swans upon it, the moonlight on the
Cupids that kept guard at intervals along the top of a snakelike
stone fence&mdash;and Fitch, vital, happy in his work, happy in his
friends, happy in life, as he had planned to live it in the years to
come. And death waiting him across the water!</p>

<p>"Beau Brummell" began Clyde Fitch's career as a dramatist.
It was produced at the New York Madison Square Theatre, May
17, 1890. At that time he had not evinced any determination to
be a dramatist&mdash;but was writing juvenile sketches for <i>The
Churchman</i>, afterwards gathered in a charming volume called "The
Knighting of the Twins, and Ten Other Tales" (1891). Previous
to this, he had attempted "A Wave of Life"&mdash;a novel whose chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
value is autobiographic. Then he showed his clever facility at
dialogue in a collection of "Six Conversations and Some Correspondence;"
also in "The Smart Set." But, after the success of
"Brummell," followed by "Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lema&icirc;tre" (December 1,
1890) for Henry Miller, a dramatic season hardly passed that
Fitch was not represented on the bill-boards by two or three
comedies. It was very rarely that he rewrote his dramas under
new titles; it was unusual for him to use over again material
previously exploited. Exceptions to this were in the cases of
"The Harvest," a one-act sketch given by the New York Theatre
of Arts and Letters (January 26, 1893), afterwards (April 11,
1898) included as an act of "The Moth and the Flame;" "Mistress
Betty" (October 15, 1895), for Mme. Modjeska, afterwards
revamped as "The Toast of the Town" (November 27, 1905) for
Viola Allen. Interest in the period of Beau Brummell stretched
over into "The Last of the Dandies" for Beerbohm Tree. But
otherwise the bulk of his work came each season as a Fitch
novelty. He often played against himself, the popularity of one
play killing the chances of the other. For instance, when "Lovers'
Lane" opened in New York, there were also running "Captain
Jinks of the Horse Marines," "Barbara Frietchie" and "The
Climbers." When "The Cowboy and the Lady" was given in
Philadelphia, "Nathan Hale" beat it in box-office receipts, and
Fitch wrote to a friend: "If any play is going to beat it, I'd rather
it was one of mine, eh?"</p>

<p>By the time he was ready to write "The Moth and the Flame,"
Fitch had won distinction with a variety of picturesque pieces,
like "His Grace de Grammont," for Otis Skinner, and "Nathan
Hale," for Goodwin and Maxine Elliott. It may be said to have
come just when his vivacity was on the increase, for touches in
it gave foretaste of his later society dramas, and showed his planning,
in the manner of the French, for excellent theatrical effect.
He was to become more expert in the use of materials, but no
whit less clever in his expansion of "small talk" and society
shallowness.</p>

<p>"The Harvest" is an early example of Fitch's method of workmanship.
It was carefully planned and quickly written; in
fact, it was set down on paper while Fitch was on the four o'clock
train between New York and Boston; his motive was to show
the dangerous power and fascination of a clever, dissipated,
attractive man-of-the-world on a young girl, who, in her innocence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
does not understand the warnings given her on all sides.
The idea grew in his mind, and this growth resulted in "The Moth
and the Flame," which entered more fully into the "fast" life of a
man about town, and the dangerous ignorance of the society
girl. Fitch loved to sketch the smart woman, like <i>Mrs. Lorrimer</i>,
who, as someone has said, is frivolously constituted, but sharply
witty and with some depth of heart. The fancy-dress party
scene is autobiographic, he having attended such an occasion at
Carroll Beckwith's studio, in New York. In technique, this
scene is comparable with the one of similar gaiety in "Lord and
Lady Algy"&mdash;both having an undercurrent of serious strain.
The tragedy motive is relieved at almost calculated times by
comedy, which shows that Fitch held to the old dramatic theory
of comic relief. Often this was irritating, discounting the mood
he was trying to maintain. He was not as skilful in the use of
these varying elements as Pinero, with whom he might be
compared&mdash;not for strength of characterization, for fullness of
story or for the sheer art of interest, but for creative vitality and
variety, as well as for literary feeling in the use of materials. But
more important than all these was his desire to be true to the
materials he had selected. On this subject he always had much
to say, and his comments about Truth in the theatre comprise an
enlightening exposition of his dramatic theory. This it is well to
examine. In 1901, he adapted, from the French, "Sapho"&mdash;to the
production of which was attached some unpleasant notoriety&mdash;and
"The Marriage Game." And of these he wrote (in <i>Harper's
Weekly</i>), in response to current criticism, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is only fair to myself and to my work done on the two plays to
say that my intention and desire in both instances were to be faithful
to the French original, and to have the outcome a resultant moral&mdash;to
the good. To put it mildly, I do not seem to have created that
impression exactly in the minds of the public. From their verdict
and yours I have picked myself up, pulled myself together, and realized
my failure. I had thought I was taking a building from one
country and rebuilding it in another with the same stones, but I
discovered I had apparently pulled down one structure and raised no
other. Believe me, no one regretted this more than I. But I think
I have finally learned my lesson. I have learned another thing that
I can't do, and I have added it to the list of things I sha'n't try to do.
What I <i>am</i> trying to do is to reflect life of all kinds as I see it. To
write, first, plays that will interest and mean something; and, after
that, amuse. I would rather entertain everybody than one body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
And always and in any case with a result to the good. I am trying
especially to reflect our own life of the present, and to get into the
heart of the pictures made by the past. To do this I do not consider
any detail too small, so long as it is not boring. Nor any method
wrong which I feel to be true. I am naturally not always believed
in, and I do not always make myself clear. Sometimes I think I am
misunderstood through laziness. To give one instance, of one or the
other: in a recent play of mine, 'The Climbers', something which I
meant to be psychologically true was taken to be a theatrical trick.
A man who was dishonest in business, but who loved his wife with
the really strong love that such weak natures are capable of, is asked
to look that wife in the face and, before a group of angry friends and
relatives, confess the extent of his crime, his disgrace! I felt, and I
still feel, the man couldn't look into his wife's eyes and say the
whole ugly truth. And doubly he couldn't with the to him cruel
environment of the outraged circle holding back the sympathy of his
wife from him. He would feel and cry out to her, 'Let me tell you
alone, if I must tell it, and <i>in the dark, in the dark</i>!' when he could
not see the heart-breaking shame grow upon her face, nor see his
own guilty face reflected in her eyes. The end of this sentence he
would reiterate, grasping it, too, on the impulse, as a means to put
off the ordeal. 'In the dark,&mdash;later in the dark', he would tell her
everything. But there is no time to be lost if a public scandal is to be
averted. The worst must be known at once. The chief friend of
them all is there. It is he who is to fight hardest to save them. He
knows the house well, and besides he has seen that very evening, after
dinner, the lights turned on by the servant with the electric lever. He
stands beside this lever. He quickly seizes the last sentence of the
cornered guilty man, and, before the latter can think or retract, cries:
'Tell it in the dark, then!' and plunges the room in darkness. The
natural impulse of that defaulter under those circumstances would
be to blurt out with it; at least so I believe. Such was his vacillating,
impulsive nature. And for the same reason the attempt to escape
in the dark, which was silly, futile! It was another sudden impulse;
had it been otherwise, he was far too sensible to have tried it. I
developed that scene by taking the place mentally, or trying to, of
each one of the persons engaged in it. I did not start with the so-called
'dark scene'. I had no idea I was going to do what I did until
I reached the moment in my writing when it had to be done&mdash;at least
done that way or not at all. As it occurred to me, so it would have
occurred to the friend in the play. And so it did! And knowing this
evolution of the scene, I cannot think myself that it was 'a theatrical
trick'. In all cases I try to paint my personages from the inside
instead of the out, and to cling to human nature as both my starting-point
and my goal. This is what I want to do and am trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
to do&mdash;in a sentence&mdash;to tell the Truth in the Theatre. I am trying
honestly, and my heart is in it. That's all, except that I am glad of
your belief in me.</p></div>

<p>This frankness and sincerity were typical of Fitch's correspondence
with everyone who took him seriously. He went to every
pains to explain himself, and no man more gratefully acknowledged
earnest attention. It was his quickness to detect in others
the spark of creative appreciation that made him answer letters
to perfect strangers, giving them advice as to playwriting. "I like
the tone of that man's note," he once said to me. "I'll send for
him; he may be a good actor."</p>

<p>It was not often that he wrote on the theory of his work. There
is an essay by him, published in 1904, and called "The Play and
the Public." It is often quoted. But a good thing bears constant
repetition, and the following sounds Fitch's conviction on a
fundamental belief:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I feel myself very strongly the particular value&mdash;a value which,
rightly or wrongly, I can't help feeling inestimable&mdash;in a modern
play of reflecting absolutely and truthfully the life and environment
about us; every class, every kind, every emotion, every motive,
every occupation, every business, every idleness! Never was life so
varied, so complex; what a choice, then! Take what strikes you
most, in the hope it will interest others. Take what suits you most
to do&mdash;what perhaps you can do best&mdash;and then do it better. Be
truthful, and then nothing can be too big, nothing should be too
small, so long as it is here, and <i>there</i>! Apart from the question of
literature, apart from the question of art, reflect the real thing with
true observation and with sincere feeling for what it is and what it
represents, and that is art and literature in a modern play. If you
inculcate an idea in your play, so much the better for your play and
for you&mdash;and for your audience. In fact, there is small hope for your
play <i>as</i> a play if you haven't some small idea in it somewhere and
somehow, even if it is hidden&mdash;it is sometimes better for you if it is
hidden, but it must of course be integral. Some ideas are mechanical.
Then they are no good. These are the ideas for which the author does
all the work, instead of letting the ideas do the work for him. One
should write what one sees, but observe under the surface. It is a
mistake to look at the reflection of the sky in the water of theatrical
convention. Instead, look up and into the sky of real life
itself.</p></div>

<p>All sound advice, and a compressed manual of dramatic technique
for the beginner! But Fitch had the darting eye of a
migratory interest. He often didn't "follow through," as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
say in golf. With the result that he is often scored for insufficient
motivation. But my knowledge of him makes me realize he felt
and saw deeper than his epigrammatic style indicated. His
technique was therefore often threadbare in spots,&mdash;not of that
even mesh which makes of Pinero such an exceptional designer.
I would put Fitch's "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines" above
Edward Sheldon's "Romance" for the faithful reproduction of
early New York atmosphere. I would put it by the side of
Pinero's "Trelawney of the 'Wells'." But there is no play of
Fitch's which, for strength, I would hold beside "The Thunderbolt."
In his feminine analyses, too, he did not probe as deep as
Pinero.</p>

<p>Within a few months of his death, Fitch was asked to deliver
an address on the theatre at Harvard and at Yale. He enlarged
his magazine article on "The Play and the Public" for that
purpose. It is now easily accessible, included in the fourth volume
of the Memorial Edition of his plays. It was found among
his many papers and unfinished manuscripts. There is no
recent playwright whose "Life and Letters" are more worthy of
preservation. I have looked through most of the materials;
have seen letters descriptive of his childhood in Schenectady,
New York, (he was born, May 2, 1865 in Elmira); have read
accounts of his student days at Amherst, where vagaries of dress
used to stir his associates to student pranks; have relished an
illustrated diary he kept while tutoring in his early years of
struggle, his father refusing to countenance playwriting instead
of architecture. These early years were filled with the same vivacity,
affection and sympathy which later made him such a rare
friend. It bears repeating what has been often said before&mdash;he
had a genius for friendship, and an equal genius for losing those
he did not want.</p>

<p>Such a biography as should be written of his picturesque popularity
as a playwright would mostly be autobiographic. For a
letter from Fitch had rare flavour, more personal than his plays
but of the same Fitchean quality. It would, as well, be a personal
record of the stage, and would set at rest many myths that have
floated around his name&mdash;such as William Winter wilfully circulated
about "Beau Brummell."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Moth and the Flame" is here reproduced because it has
never before been issued, and should be made available to the
student of American Drama. To say that it is typically Fitchean
does not mean that, in technique or in characterization, it is his
best. But it is confession that whatever he wrote bore that
incommunicable touch which gives him a unique position&mdash;a
position no American playwright thus far has been able to usurp.</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_I" id="ACT_I"></a>ACT I.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>. <i>The First Act takes place in the</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton's</span> <i>house during a
large fancy ball. All the guests are in children's costumes&mdash;that
being insisted upon in the invitations. The stage represents a
reception-room; the end of a conservatory, or ball-room, being
seen through a large archway. In the upper right hand corner
of the stage is a small stage built with curtains and foot-lights, for
an amateur vaudeville performance, which is taking place.</i></p>

<p><i>At rise of curtain the room is filled with guests in costume, on chairs
before improvised stage, and the curtain of stage is just falling, as
one of the Lady Guests&mdash;who, dressed (and blacked) as a small
Darky Girl, has been singing a popular negro ballad ("Warmest
Baby.") The mimic curtain rises again, owing to the applause of
the mimic audience. The chorus of song is repeated and the
curtain again falls to applause. There is a general movement
among guests&mdash;with laughter and conversation.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discovered</span>. <span class="smcap">Marion Wolton</span>, <i>dressed in Empire Child's gown,
is sitting in one of the third row of chairs next the foot-lights.
Up to now her back is partly turned toward the audience.</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty
Rand</span>, <i>dressed in short skirts, is just behind her</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Leaning over to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] I think, Marion, this was
really a most amusing idea of yours, having us all come as children.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas Rhodes</span>, <i>in white sailor costume. He meets</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Wolton</span> <i>who enters. They talk.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.] Your costume, Kitty, is charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>With a ball on rubber cord.</i>] My dear, I'm sure I look
a sight. I feel as if it were bathing hour at Narragansett.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Here's Bessie. How splendid she was. [<i>Rises.</i>]
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bessie</span>. <i>She laughs as she is greeted by shouts of laughter
and applause by guests. She joins</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>, <i>who shakes her hand</i>.]
You were too funny, Bessie. [<i>A guest rises and offers seat to</i>
<span class="smcap">Bessie</span>. <i>She accepts it and sits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> [<i>Monkey; white kilt suit.</i>] [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Bessie</span> <i>as she
sits</i>.] Yes. Isn't this an awfully lovely party? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>.]
Here, Fanshaw, it's your turn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guests</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">All</span>. Yes, come on Fanshaw, etc. [<span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>
<i>exits</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> <i>comes from</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>, <i>nodding pleasantly to guests
as he passes round behind them, to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>. <i>He shakes her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Why so late, Douglas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I was dining with Mrs. Lorrimer; but I hope
you've saved me a seat by you. [<span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>exits, ready for stage</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I'm sorry, but I haven't. There's the curtain.</p>

<p><i>She sits and</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>takes a place back of guests, shaking hands
with</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>as he does so. Mimic curtain rises, music begins,
all interrupt with "Sh-h."</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>enters on mimic stage,
dressed as Little Lord Fauntleroy, and sings. Mimic curtain
falls to applause. Curtain is raised. Black rag-baby thrown to
him during song.</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>enters, bows, and, as he does so,</i>
<span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>throws a small bouquet of flowers to him. This he
catches and makes entrance upon stage by jumping over mimic
foot-lights. He is congratulated and thanked by</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and
resumes his seat</i>.</p>

<p><i>Music begins. All interrupt again with "Sh-h." Curtain is
raised, and enter</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>, <i>dressed as a child of 1840, in white and
green. She comes forward and sings</i> ("<i>Henrietta</i>"), <i>with orchestral
accompaniment, a flute obligato being a feature of the latter,
which, every little while, indulges in loud variations, entirely
drowning the singer's voice, much to her annoyance, and the only
half-suppressed amusement of the guests. As she reaches the
chorus all</i> (<i>at</i> <span class="smcap">Marion's</span> <i>suggestion</i>) <i>join in with her and finish
the song</i>. <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>rises, giving the signal that the entertainment
is over. Servants come in and take away most of the chairs, leaving
one in centre of stage and three up toward the left centre. All rise
and form groups; those of guests near the door move into ball-room
and off.</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>enters, and</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>at once greets her,</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>joining them</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Thank you ever so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Yes, indeed. Isn't this an awfully lovely party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>With large hoople and stick; quickly, much put out</i>.]
My dear Marion, I could choke that flute player.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Don't be selfish, Ethel; the man wanted to be
heard. [<i>Goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> If I were a witch, I'd curse him with asthma. Mr.
Johnstone, go and curse him for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> With pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Just give him a piece of my mind. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Girl</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> [<i>Flatteringly.</i>] He doesn't deserve such a gift. But isn't this a lovely party? Will you excuse me? [<i>He goes
up stage to</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, <i>offers his arm, which she takes, and they exit.</i>
<span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>watch</i> <span class="smcap">Blanche</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>, <i>amused.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel.</span>] Just look at Blanche. Do you suppose she's going to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> She's going to with all her might and main, if he
will only ask her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> A large if&mdash; [<i>Laughing.</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gertrude</span>
<i>join</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>down stage.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Looks as if Johnny were getting pretty stuck on
Blanche, doesn't it? [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>. <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>moves up centre.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Yes, or just the other way round. [<i>All laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude.</span> Who are you dancing the cotillon with, Ethel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Don't know. I've promised two men, but I haven't
made up my mind who I'll dance with yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> A nice person to engage for a partner. [<i>Calling.</i>]
Trimmins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Sh-h! He's one of the men I've promised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Never mind. I'm the other. [<i>All
laugh.</i> <span class="smcap">Gertrude</span> <i>says</i>, "Oh, Ethel!" <span class="smcap">Gertrude</span> <i>goes toward</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion, Ethel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>at same time.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>.] Who are you dancing the cotillon
with, Trimmins?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> Ethel Stevens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> Ethel Stevens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> I'll bet a fiver you're not. She's dancing with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> [<i>Very pleased.</i>] Delighted! I owe you the five
with joy. [<i>Rushes</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>out of the way. Crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">Gertrude</span>.]
Will you give me the pleasure? [<span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>out at back,
exits.</i>] Thank you. [<i>Offers his arm, which</i> <span class="smcap">Gertrude</span> <i>takes, and
they go out at back.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Are you going to stand perfectly still and be robbed
in that manner? [<i>Laughing.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Well, but what am I&mdash; [<i>Interrupted by one
of the girl guests, who says</i>, "I'm here!"] Oh, so you are. [<i>Puts his
arm in hers, and they run off together.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Marion, isn't Mr. Ned Fletcher coming to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes. [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I'm so glad; he's quite the most amusing man in
town this winter. [<i>Sitting on chair which servant left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> And so many people won't ask him to their houses,
you know. Mamma won't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Well, you know, your mother's a ridiculous person;
she asks lots of awfully fast men!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Yes, but they are all relatives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>Putting arm around</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>, <i>pricks her finger.</i>] I
don't believe Net Fletcher is as bad as people hint. He's too
good looking. [<i>Fixing dress.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> And I don't care whether he's bad or not, he's
charming enough to make up for it. Besides, I suppose all
men are bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I mean all nice men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Where has Mr. Fletcher been before this winter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> My dear, he's one of those men who live all over the
place&mdash;most of the time in Europe&mdash;but he's been here always
off and on&mdash;and in Newport and in Lenox he has yachts and
things, don't you know! [<i>Exits down right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Enters.</i>] Girls, will you go into the ball-room,
till the men get the tables ready here? [<i>She speaks aside to
one of the servants, and exits. Servants bring on small table and
place it with bottles, lunch, etc., a broken glass covered with napkins
to fall on stage. Place seven chairs about table. Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> <i>Of course.</i> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <i>crossing to her.</i>] Do you
notice how she won't talk about Fletcher and won't listen to
any one else either?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> My dear, she's heels over head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Poor Douglas Rhodes! [<i>Half smiling, in part satire.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Serves him right for hanging around her all his life!
Why didn't he flirt with one of us girls for a time, if only to make
her jealous! [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>sees</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>enter, and tries to warn</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>.
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>gives</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>a violent pull of the arm to warn her to stop
speaking of</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] You can't stay here; we're driven out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Come, help us make fun of the other people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> In a few minutes. I must give you a chance to
make fun of me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, we've been doing that for years! [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>blows</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> <i>whistle which he has suspended from neck, pulling
it out of his pocket.</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>smile coquettishly at</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>and exit into ball-room, arm in arm. Distant music off
stage.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>follows up centre. A pause. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marion.</span>
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>up stage, looks admiringly at her, and smiles. Then,
smiling and putting himself into a boyish attitude, he says boyishly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Hello, Molly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling back, catching his mood, speaks girlishly.</i>]
Hello, Dug! It does take one back to old days, doesn't it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> That was what I was thinking of, Marion, the days
of dancing-school. How good you were to always be my partner,
even though I couldn't reverse without treading on your toes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] You were a bad dancer&mdash;and death to
slippers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> And the children's parties, with the old games,
"Post Office," "Copenhagen," "Kiss in the Ring."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling mischievously.</i>] You were good enough at
"Kiss in the Ring" to make up for your not reversing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>With real sentiment, crosses to her.</i>] Do you remember
it all as well as I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Realizing his sentiment, and trying to change their
mood, but pleasantly.</i>] Of course I do! We were great friends
then, as we are now, and as I hope we always will be, Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But if we played the old games again, would it be
the same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No, no, things are never the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But would you let me choose you always? Would
you pretend not to see me coming, so I could slap your hands on
the Copenhagen rope and take my reward? If we played "Post
Office," would <i>I</i> have all my letters from <i>your</i> lips! Would
you mind if, in "bow to the wittiest, kneel to the prettiest, and kiss
the one you loved best," I choose you again, openly, for all three?
Would you give me <i>all</i> your dances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>More serious, though still smiling kindly, sweetly.</i>]
That's just it, Douglas! You can reverse now, and there are
so many other girls wanting partners!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Besides, after all, we're only children <i>outside</i> to-night;
our <i>hearts</i> have come of age!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Yes, Marion, but, boy's and man's, my heart's the
same. I want the same partner I did then, only I want her
for the game of life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I am so sorry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Sorry? Then you won't let your hands lie on the
rope for me any more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I am very fond of you, Douglas, and I always
was, but&mdash; [<i>She hesitates.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>A little bitterly, disappointed.</i>] I know what
you mean. I was all right for dancing-school, but life is a more
serious matter&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>goes to chair and sits down.</i>] I
know I'm not like you, Marion&mdash;I know what an intellectual
woman you are, and what an ordinary sort of fellow I am. But I
<i>love</i> you! and I hoped&mdash; [<i>He breaks off and continues with his
first idea.</i>] You went to a woman's college, and I <i>only</i> to a <i>man's</i>&mdash;You
made a study of sociology&mdash;I, [<i>Smiling.</i>] principally of athletics.
I know I never read books, and you seem to read everything.
But I love you. You have your clubs for working girls,
your charities; I know the busy, helpful life you lead. You have
so much in it, I was in hopes that what room was left for a <i>husband</i>
was so little, even <i>I</i> could fill it. And somehow or other I've
always taken it for granted you more or less understood, and
were&mdash;willing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I was&mdash;once&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You were?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> There was no one in the world I liked so much to
be with as you, and I think I, too, believed my happiness was
in your hands, and that some day we would decide together it was
so. But I lately&mdash; [<i>She hesitates.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Some one else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I don't like you one bit less, Douglas, only&mdash; [<i>Rises.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Only you liked some one else more! I was afraid
so. I've heard whispers and guesses&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Don't let it make any difference with <i>us</i>, Douglas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You love him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You see, every one is against him, and I feel that
I have a chance to save him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You believe in him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Shortly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Would you believe anything against him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>On the defensive, indignant.</i>] <i>No!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> If some one told you of something dishonourable
this man had done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I would suspect the motive of the person who told
me. Do you think I haven't heard plenty of gossip against
him? Every girl I know has done her best to take away his
character, and <i>begged me to introduce him to her</i> in the same
breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> And if I spoke against him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Leaning on back of chair.</i>] I know I couldn't
help it, after what you have told me; I should have to feel
you might be influenced by jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> To <i>unjustly</i> accuse a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Oh, Douglas, no, of course you would believe what
you said, but I wouldn't trust your judgment. Don't I know
every one is down on him. Even you men; are all the men in
New York so proud of their past lives&mdash;not to mention the
<i>present</i> of several I know?&mdash;Well, if men turn a cold shoulder,
then we women must give him our hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You girls don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Oh, girls understand a good deal nowadays. Society
and some of the newspapers attend to that. He doesn't pretend
to be a saint to me&mdash;I find him perfectly frank&mdash;and I am afraid
he has been rather fast! But I don't believe he is capable of an
outright dishonourable action, and nothing would make me believe it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> No proof?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Only the proof of my own eyes. When I see him
do something contemptible, then I'll believe <i>half</i> the stories
I hear of him! [<i>Moving a little up centre.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I see you <i>do</i> love him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I do, though you are the only person I have confessed
it to,&mdash;not even to him&mdash;and forgive me, [<i>Down a little.</i>]
but I never liked you less than I do now when you have spoken
against him. [<i>Up to arch.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Following her.</i>] No, tell me you will forget it, and
keep me the same old friend, and I'll promise not to speak against
him to you again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Very well&mdash; [<i>They shake hands.</i>] Why,
I want you two to be the best of friends&mdash;you <i>must</i> be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Also smiling.</i>] Oh, I don't promise that&mdash;I haven't
given you up yet, and I sha'n't until&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] When&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Until I see you going into the church
to be married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You'll say nothing more against Ned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Not to you. [<i>Moving down, right centre.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Oh, but you will to others? [<i>Follows.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I will say what I have to say to&mdash;<i>him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> To <i>him?</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>. <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>is dressed in

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Marion, here's another little boy. [<span class="smcap">Marion</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> It's too bad you missed the vaudeville.</p>

his eyes on</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>he has struck glasses and
a bottle on the little supper-table beside them. They crash on the

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Oh! Mrs. Wolton, forgive me; how clumsy!
[<i>Starts to pick up.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> No, never mind. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>enters</i>.] Here

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Mr. Dawson, my brother! Why, he's in Boston,
Howes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Beg pardon, m'm, but he must have returned to-day.
Most important, he says, m'm. Where shall I show him?
The ladies and gentlemen are playing "Blind Man's Buff"
in Mr. Wolton's room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> This is the quietest place. Show Mr. Dawson in
here. Where is Mr. Wolton?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> [<i>Trying not to smile.</i>] He's blind-folded, m'm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Yes, come, I will take Mr. Wolton's place! I

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> What's going on here, Howes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> A children's party, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> A what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> A children's party, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Who are the children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Mr. Wolton and Miss Wolton, sir, and her friends.
Mr. Wolton's playing games now, sir, but he said he would join
you in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Out loud, involuntarily, but speaking to himself&mdash;very
seriously, almost tragically.</i>] Playing games! My God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Yes, sir&mdash;one don't know what rich folks'll do
next, sir. <i>We're</i> in hopes, in the kitchen, they'll take to pretending
they're the servants, sir, and turn us loose in the ball-room. [<i>Smiling. Exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Who hardly hears</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.] Playing games, with
ruin and disgrace staring him in the face. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>Flushed and gay&mdash;an elderly man in knickerbockers
and evening coat, a sort of English Court costume. The
handkerchief, which was tied around his eyes in the game, has
slipped, and lies about his neck.</i>] Well, Fred, what's the good
news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> The worst there could be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>Half whispers.</i>] What do you mean!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Dragging off the Blind Man's Buff handkerchief from</i>

morning?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> So soon&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> How much longer did you think you could stave it
off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>Sinks exhausted into a chair.</i>] I didn't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Why didn't you tell me your credit was as exhausted
in Boston as here? [<i>Taking chair from table, and sitting right of</i>
<span class="smcap">Wolton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> I thought, with you doing the negotiating, it
mightn't be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Well, it is; do you hear me, you haven't any such
thing as <i>credit there</i> nor <i>here!</i> nor anywhere, for aught I know!
To-morrow is the last day of grace. Your sister-in-law has to pay
this money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> What did you let her buy that house for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>Testily.</i>] How could I help it! My brother
didn't appoint me her guardian! He simply left her money in
trust in my hands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> "In trust in your hands!" [<i>Laughs cruelly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> Don't do that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> And you speculated with it, and lost every cent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> What a scoundrel you are! [<span class="smcap">Wolton</span> <i>squirms
miserably in his chair.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>adds quietly</i>.] And yet I don't
suppose there's at this moment a more popular man in New
York, socially, than you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> No, I don't believe there is!&mdash;but a damned lot
of good it does me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Will your sister-in-law accept her ruin quietly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> No, she's never liked me; she'll take pleasure in
exposing me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> But for your <i>wife</i> and <i>child's</i> sake!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> You know very well she <i>hates them</i>! They have
never taken her up; she wasn't possible, socially. [<span class="smcap">Dawson</span>
<i>laughs again bitterly</i>.] <i>Don't</i> do that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Well, then, after ruining yourself and your brother's
wife, you must ruin your <i>own</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>Alarmed, uneasy</i>.] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I mean that my sister's own money is enough to
pay for your sister's silence. Don't you understand? Your
sister mustn't know, of course, that you've stolen her fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
Instead, your wife must be told,&mdash;poor Laura&mdash;and for her
daughter's sake, she must consent to beggar herself. Her bonds
will about meet the payment of the house to-morrow&mdash;they must
be sold the first thing&mdash;I will see to it.&mdash;&mdash; [<i>As he speaks, he is
looking</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton</span> <i>straight in the face. Something in</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton's</span> <i>face

He breaks off suddenly</i>.] What! you've taken hers, too! [<i>He
leans over</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton</span> <i>in the chair, his hands on his shoulders, close
to his neck, in a rage. Rises.</i>] You've beggared <i>my sister</i>, your
wife and child! You&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>With a big effort, rises, throwing off</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson's</span> <i>hands</i>.]
Sh!&mdash;For God's sake, lower your voice! You'll be heard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>With a change of tone, but speaking with utter contempt</i>.]
By a couple hundred fools! To-morrow <i>thousands</i> will
hear of your dirty dishonour!! [<i>Going toward right a little</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.] But <i>you</i>, you have money&mdash;won't
you come to my rescue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I couldn't if I would. You have borrowed half a
fortune of me already. What I have left must go to take care
of my sister and niece. Do you think I'd support <i>you</i>! No,
the <i>State</i> will do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> That!! You'd let me go to&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> You'll get twenty years at least!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> You won't help me <i>escape</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> But Laura? she loves me, and Marion. <i>They</i>
will suffer for me; I may be weakly dishonourable, but I've
always loved them, and they me. Besides, any public dishonour
which comes to my name must touch theirs too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I'm not so sure about that&mdash;I think there is material
for a divorce here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> A divorce! My God, must I lose everything!
Show a little pity, Fred! Remember the old days at school;
was I a bad boy? We were chums for years, you know it!&mdash;You
were my best man when I married Laura, and you were
the gayest at the wedding! It's only been this curse of gambling
with the stocks that has driven me to the devil,&mdash;that and my
cursed luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> <i>Luck</i> has nothing to do with <i>honour</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> You don't know&mdash;oftener than you think, it has
everything! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Supper is ready, sir. Can we have this room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes, Howes, I'm going!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Thank you, sir. [<i>Exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> Give me a word of hope, Fred!&mdash;something!
What are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Nothing till to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> And that's all you have to say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> All. [<i>The two men stand looking at each other a
moment in a sort of grim embarrassment, then</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>exits.
Music. It must be evident to the audience, though not to the hysterically
excited</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton</span>, <i>that</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>has a little, a very little,
pity, but doesn't wish to show it,&mdash;at any rate not yet</i>. <span class="smcap">Wolton</span>, <i>who
has stood a moment lost in thought, an expression of despair in his
face, shudders and comes to himself. He looks around to see that
he is alone. He grasps his forehead tight a moment in his right
hand, drops his hand, and with compressed lips nods his head
determinedly. He is standing by one of the smaller supper-tables;
he looks down at it and takes up a silver knife at one of the places,
feels its dull edge, and throws it down sneering. A</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>
<i>appears</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> Howes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> [<i>Coming into the room and going to</i> <span class="smcap">Wolton</span>.] Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> I am going up to my room. [<i>With a motion of his

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wolton.</span> <i>On no account am I to be disturbed.</i> No one is to

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wolton</span>, <i>who is half way between centre and door right, turns for
a moment, looking about the room. He is seized with a nervous

door</i>. <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>appear in ball-room doorway, at

[<i>She sits. A</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>passes them bouillon which they take and eat.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Don't be foolish; girls at a ball nowadays can't expect

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, my dear, a brute of a flute player ruined it. I
felt like thirty cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> No one could spend much more money on a

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Does Marion show her age in a child's dress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> She looks charmingly, but then Marion isn't so old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Perhaps not so old as she usually looks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, Mrs. Lorrimer, do be decent. You haven't been
divorced a year yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> My dear, divorce isn't like death&mdash;you don't
have to go into mourning! Besides, that's what I want to get
married for! I find I've a perfect passion for divorce! Just
like men have it for drink. The more I get the more I want!
[<i>Laugh.</i>] I've only had two divorces, and I want another!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> You must be damned careful&mdash;I beg your
pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, don't apologize, I say it myself!&mdash;careful
about what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> What sort of <i>husband you choose</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Exactly! None of your <i>ideal</i> men for me! I
want a man with a bad record! [<i>Laugh.</i>] Plenty of proof concealed
about his person, or not buried too deep in his past for
me and my lawyer to ferret out. I've a perfect duck of a lawyer!
He made up every bit of evidence about my last husband; that
won me my case, and, my dears, it just <i>happened</i> to turn out to
be true! [<i>Laugh.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Speaking of records, who do you think is here to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> <i>Ned</i> Fletcher&mdash;!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Girls&mdash;I'll tell you a secret&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> I don't want to hear it. [<i>Takes a chair left centre,
sits and lights cigarette.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I'm crazy about him! Where is he? [<i>Glancing
over her shoulder.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You've no chance; he's going to marry Marion, if
she'll have him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> What a shame! And will she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> She's mad about him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> The moth and the flame! What a pity! because
he'd be simply ideal for me! Why, do you know I hear
that he&mdash; [<i>Stops suddenly, looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> What do you hear? I'm in this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I forgot Johnny and Mr. Fanshaw&mdash;there
are certain things you mustn't talk about before innocent little
boys!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> You couldn't tell <i>us anything about Ned Fletcher</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] I don't want to! But I thought
Marion was always going to marry Douglas Rhodes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, that's all off now. It's Ned Fletcher or nothing
with Marion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Laughing</i>.] I believe she thinks she's going to reform
him! [<i>All laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> There's one thing, he isn't after Marion's money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Is he so rich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Oh, rotten! [<span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>slaps</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Very well, do you know what I shall do? I
shall take Douglas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Hastily.</i>] Yes, catch his heart on the rebound;
they say it's easier that way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> That's one on you, Mrs. Lorrimer. [<i>Party gag.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, I'm not so very old, and have had two
splendid husbands already. I don't think I have to bother about
the easiest way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Philopene, Ethel? That's one on <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Has it been your method, my dear, because
if so I can't congratulate you on the result. You must look out
for a stronger rebound next time! Try a divorced man; I hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
they come back with a terrific force! I'll be generous; try
one of mine. [<i>All laugh. As they stop laughing there is the sound
of something heavy falling in the room above. The chandelier trembles
slightly, the lustres sound. All four lift their heads and listen a
moment. A short pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> What was that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> The servants probably, upstairs! [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>from ball-room, smiling at the table of people as she passes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> [<i>As she comes.</i>] Here's Miss Wolton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> My dear Marion, pardon me for not rising,
but I assure you I look much better sitting down! [<span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>stops by</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Not at all, Mrs. Lorrimer, they're awfully lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, I'm sure they don't compare with yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Oh, I don't know, there are others. [<span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>goes down centre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Marion, is Mr. Dawson here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No, he's in Boston.&mdash;Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, nothing, only he's an unmarried man, so I
thought I'd ask. [<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>in ball-room takes away plates, and
second</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>passes ices</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] Why are you so late, Emily?
[<i>Back to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> My little girl was seedy, and I couldn't get
away until I saw her asleep comfortably. It's an awful care for a
young woman, my dear, having a <i>posthumous</i> child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> A what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> A <i>posthumous</i> child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] <i>How do you mean, Emily?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Why, born after it's father's divorce!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Are you girls going to have coffee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Nor I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Very well, then; join us for another game&mdash; [<i>She
makes a movement of starting.</i>] Unless you men want to
smoke. In that case, take your coffee in the library, where you'll
find cigarettes and other smoking materials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> [<i>Who has a cigarette in his mouth, and has been
smoking all through the supper.</i>] I say! Oughtn't I to have
smoked here?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] No! [<i>She starts to go out through ball-room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> I beg your pardon. Well, any way it's an awfully
lovely party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Marion, is it true you're going to be divorced&mdash;I
mean married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>By doorway.</i>] Married? I hope so, some day.
[<i>Smiling, exits into ball-room.</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>is eating ice</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>crosses to him</i>. <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>in front of table</i>. <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>takes
up lamb</i>. <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Haven't you finished your ice, Johnny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> No. I like to squash mine all up, and eat it soft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Johnny, who made your bow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Mother. [<span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>drives</i> <span class="smcap">Johnny</span> <i>out of room by
hitting him with her ball</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and takes lamb</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Who has looked back over her shoulder into the ball-room,
goes up to arch</i>.] Mr. Fletcher has joined Marion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, that's why Marion wished us to hurry!
She wanted this room for herself and Fletcher!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> <i>Probably.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Let's go&mdash;as if we were gone for good, and
then stroll back <i>casually</i> in a few minutes, and see how we find
them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Isn't that eavesdropping?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Don't be absurd! There isn't any such thing
as eavesdropping nowadays. Everybody listens to everything they
can, and everyone more or less knows they're being listened to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> But what good will it do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Why, if we&mdash;come back and catch them with
his arm around her, we can take it for granted they are engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I don't think that follows. I'm sure if I were engaged
to every man I let&mdash; [<i>She stops quickly. All laugh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] You gave yourself away that time,
Ethel! [<i>They move out by door into ball-room. As they do so,</i>
<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>enters from right, and</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>enters, meeting girls and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Going to dance?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No, play games. Kissing games. [<i>All laugh
and exeunt.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Oh, Mrs. Lorrimer! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Why did you run away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I was afraid if I didn't the servants would never
get this room ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Have you a partner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Pleased to be with her and yet embarrassed.</i>] May I&mdash;will
you&mdash;that is&mdash;won't you dance with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Near her.</i>] I wonder why I feel so diffident with
you. I think I never was diffident before! [<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] No, you haven't that reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Smiling apologetically, but humourously.</i>] Dear
me, I hope you don't know what my reputation isn't&mdash;or <i>is</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] I don't judge a man by his reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Involuntarily half under his breath, humourously.</i>]
Thank heaven! [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>looks at him, hearing him. There is
a pause. She waits willingly for him to speak, hoping he will.</i>]
I've been a very bad fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Some of the best men in the world have begun that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> They probably had some one to help&mdash;to believe
in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> And haven't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Will you believe in me enough to&mdash; [<i>Looks off in
ball-room up a little</i>; <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>follows. He loses his control and
speaks passionately.</i>] Don't you understand,&mdash;I love you&mdash; [<i>He
embraces her; she allows him. The embrace lasts a moment.</i>]
You can be my salvation! Will you be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>In his arms, looking up at him.</i>] I will&mdash;if I can&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Whose eyes never quite look into</i> <span class="smcap">Marion's</span>, <i>loosening
the embrace.</i>] You will marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes. [<i>Kisses him, then quickly moves down right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Following her. Not looking at her.</i>] People say I'm a blackguard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> People say a great many things that aren't true.
What can a man do with all the world against him! "People"
can force him into being as bad as they say he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Then you won't believe them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No, not if you deny what they say. [<i>He holds out
his hand; she takes it. At this moment</i>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>and</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>appear in ball-room, ostentatiously counting the chairs and making small calculation about the cotillion, but really watching slyly</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>. <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>sees it and speaks to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>
<i>quickly under her breath.</i>] Don't move! Don't drop my hand,
but shake it as if we'd been making a bet, and follow my lead!
[<i>Aloud.</i>] It's settled then! You take my bet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Shaking her hand and then dropping it casually.</i> A box of cigars, against a box of gloves! [<i>Sotto voce.</i>] What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion</span> [<i>Sotto voce.</i>] Mrs. Lorrimer in the next room watching us. [<i>Speaks in low voce satirically to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>as if she were
speaking to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] Oh, no, Emily! I am going to
marry Mr. Fletcher, but <i>I</i> intend to be the one to announce that
fact, and not you. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>turn. They see</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>and pretend surprise; they remain in the ball-room.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>With trumpet.</i>] Oh! Marion! are <i>you</i> here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Ahem! [<i>With a quick, amused side glance to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.]
We've been watching you for some time; what was the matter
with the chairs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> [<i>Embarrassed.</i>] Nothing&mdash;we were merely
choosing places!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> They lead from the other end, don't they? [<i>Joining</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes, you know Kitty is leading for me. [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>. <i>He joins them.</i>] Who are you dancing with, Douglas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> No one; I'm stagging it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> You don't mean to say, Marion, you have
more men than women to-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>With mock pride.</i>] Who says I don't know how to give a party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] Damn it! I wish I hadn't
said I'd dance with little Johnny, or I'd come to your rescue.
[<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>secretly amused, bows his thanks.</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>exchange an amused glance.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] Douglas ought to give Johnny a vote
of thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Come, they are taking their places. [<i>A movement
of all to go off.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>touches</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>on the arm.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] May I speak to you just a moment?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Certainly&mdash; [<i>All go but</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] Excuse me
one moment, Miss Wolton,&mdash;Rhodes wants a word with me.
[<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>starts slightly, and, turning quickly, looks questioningly
at</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>. <i>He answers her gaze seriously and unflinchingly.
She turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] No&mdash;I won't excuse you. [<i>Assuming
a more or less coquettish air.</i>] You must come with me at once.
[<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>looks surprised, but moves as if to obey her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But why won't you trust Mr. Fletcher with me?
[<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>laughs amused</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Nonplussed for a moment; then she changes her
mind.</i>] I was only jesting. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] But you won't&mdash; [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>looking at him meaningly and seriously.</i>] &mdash;keep us
waiting long, will you? I warn you, Mr. Fletcher, I shall let them
begin without us. [<i>Exits through ball-room as</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>quickly
kisses her hand.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>waits till they are quite alone.</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>moves down right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Following. Quietly.</i>] Are you going to ask Miss
Wolton to marry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I am not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Momentary surprise&mdash;doubt, then relief&mdash;a sigh.</i>]
In that case I've nothing more to say; let's join the others.
[<i>Both make a move to go.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Who cannot resist saying it.</i>] You see, Rhodes,
I <i>have</i> asked her already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Stops and, turning, faces</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>whose back is
toward audience.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Turning leisurely.</i>] About fifteen minutes ago&mdash;but
I can't see what business it is of yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I love her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> That's no news to anybody!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> And I don't intend she shall marry a&mdash; [<i>He stops.
Short pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> What? Why don't you finish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>More quietly.</i>] A man like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Oh, I'm not so very unique; lots of girls run
the risk of marrying a man like me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I suppose you told her she is more to you than any
one in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> No. "Men like me" don't talk that rot. I put
my arms around her&mdash; [<i>Stops, interrupted by the movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
of</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>expressive of rage, controlled instantaneously; he
clenches his fists. Finishes with a half-smile at</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] And
told her I loved her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Suppressed anger.</i>] You <i>couldn't</i> say she was more
than any one else to you, because it would have been a lie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] You flatter me. [<i>Crosses to left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> The one that is <i>most</i> to <i>you</i> is <span class="smcap">your child</span>. [<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>starts; is surprised</i>.] You can't deny the child&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I "can!" I can deny anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> The lie could be proved to your face. In May,
1893, at Lenox, a young kindergarten teacher,&mdash;you blackguard,
you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>A little angry.</i>] Who told you that story?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Sneers.</i>] I'm not the only man who knows it!
That sort of thing never lies buried!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> The girl's all right now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Oh, I know, you sent her abroad, and pay for
the child. Well, that's the mother's lookout, and not mine.
But I don't believe she's the only case. One has only to look
at your life now.&mdash;It was fortunate for you this winter that
Mrs. Clipton's divorce trial didn't come off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>A little more angry. Back to</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] Still,
what has all this to do with you, and I'll deny it all besides,
if I feel like it, or need to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You know you're not fit to marry Marion Wolton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I know I love her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> For how long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I can't say, but neither can you.&mdash;And besides,
<i>she loves me</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Would she if she knew you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Smilingly.</i>] Oh, come, Rhodes, drop it! I
don't care a damn what I have done. I'm going to marry her!
I haven't made any bones about myself. I've told her I've
been a bad lot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Oh, yes, I know, you've confessed probably to
having been "fast;" that nearly always appeals to a woman,
heaven knows why; I suppose it's the instinct for reformation
in them. But how much of your life does that word "fast"
convey to a pure girl like Marion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Quite enough! [<i>Serious.</i>] But if she
did know all there was to be known, Love forgives a great deal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But not <i>everything</i>. There are certain things
Marion would never accept. She would refuse to take the
place that was the right of another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Down to him.</i>] Oh, that's your point, is it!
Well, hunt out Jeannette Gros if you can; it'll do you no good!
[<i>Crosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Follows quickly. Angry.</i>] You can't prove that,
because it's <i>not true</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Facing</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>. <i>Angry too.</i>] I'll prove she
had other lovers before me. Good God, man, you don't know
what Marion Wolton's love means to me! I've never loved
like this before! Why, if it were possible for me to treat her
as I have&mdash;the other, I <i>couldn't</i>. I want to marry Marion
Wolton&mdash;I <i>want</i> to make <i>her my wife!</i> and I <i>will!</i> I've had
all there can be got out of my old life, and I'm sick of it. Here's
my chance at a new life, and do you think I'm going to give it
up? No! [<i>Forgetting and raising his voice.</i>] Do you hear me,
No!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Softly.</i>] Not so loud!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Lowered voice.</i>] No! I'll fight for it with my last
breath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Then I say again, you're a blackguard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Laughs, turns back to audience.</i>] What do you
want to do, fight? You know we can't here. I give you liberty
to say to her all you can against me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> She won't believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Exactly&mdash;she loves me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> But there is one other I can tell the truth to, who
may believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Look out you don't make yourself ridiculous,
going about&mdash;the jilted lover, trying to take away the character
of the accepted man! [<i>Leisurely following him a little.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I don't have to do any "going about!" You are
well enough known in our world to keep most of our doors
closed against you. Few people are as blind as the Woltons,
and I will open <i>his</i> eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> You'll tell her father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> He is the one person she would listen to, and he
can verify what I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Change of tone, showing he fears this.</i>] Damn it! I mean to be a decent man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Goes close to him and looks straight in his face.</i>] Then go to Jeannette Gros and marry her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Angry again.</i>] Go to H&mdash;. [<i>Change of tone.</i>]
You think if I'm out of the way you'll get her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> She's told me she doesn't love me, and she proved
to me that she won't believe the truth of you without extraordinary
proof. There is only one person in the world who could
naturally interfere and give her anything like that proof, and
that's her father; and I shall tell him to-night, before I leave
this house, before you can announce your engagement!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> With Miss Wolton's permission, I will announce
our engagement to-night, in spite of you, and her father. [<i>Music
stops. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>, <i>with a favour, lamb and trumpet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, here you men are! If you think this is
going to be allowed, you are very much mistaken! What do
men think we ask them to parties for? Eh? Anyway, a cotillion
is a leap-year dance; on such an occasion you are our natural
prey! Come, sir! [<i>Pretending to blow trumpet.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> No. [<i>Smiling apologetically.</i>] Postpone my
pleasure till a little later in the evening, will you? Don't be
angry with me; I want to have a few words with Mr. Wolton,&mdash;then
I'll come and give <i>all</i> my favours to you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> That sounds attractive; I'll let you off.
[<i>Makes lamby squeak. Smiling, turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] But I won't
let you off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] <i>Don't</i>, please! I'm very happy to be
your <i>consolation</i> prize. [<i>Takes lamb. Music.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I'm a dangerous woman to make that remark
to. You'd better be careful, or I might take you literally at your
word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Oh, if you only would! [<i>Pulls lamb's head.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> What a charming speech. [<i>She and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>
<i>go into ball-room and off.</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>makes lamb squeak</i>.
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>, <i>her arms full of a set of gay favours, crosses the
ball-room</i>; <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>sees her and takes a step or two towards her,
then waits till she has finished speaking to the girl</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>
<i>turns, and</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>addresses her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Mrs. Wolton, is Mr. Wolton in the ball-room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> No, I think he's in the smoking-room.&mdash;Aren't
you going to dance? [<i>Coming into room.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Not just yet&mdash;later&mdash; [<i>Half bows apologetically.
At the same moment, the music swells and the procession of dancers,
in couples, dance in five or six couples into the front room, the line
curving away to right to suggest that there are very many more couples
in the ball-room out of sight. As they dance, they are laughing and
talking&mdash;the first couple turns, the other couples making bridges
under which the first couple goes, and passes into ball-room and off,
followed by each couple the same. Music softens.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>
<i>has drawn to one side, when the dancers came in. In this dance,
scarfs are used by dancers.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Mr. Wolton there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Mildly surprised.</i>] He?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I want to see Mr. Wolton very much to-night&mdash;<i>now</i>.
It is a matter of the greatest importance. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>
<i>from ball-room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Where is Mr. Wolton, Howes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> He has gone to his bedroom, m'm. [<i>Crosses behind</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Surprised, but not too much so.</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> He said he was on no account to be disturbed
until the party was over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>A little anxious.</i>] Was he ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> He didn't appear so, m'm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.] Was he feeling ill to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>With a relieved voice, showing no anxiety.</i>] No,
not at all. He was in splendid spirits. Probably he was bored
and thought he would be quieter upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I don't want to be offensive, but I must, if possible,
see him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Speaking very casually.</i>] Howes, you might go
and say to Mr. Wolton, Mr. Rhodes wants to speak to him
about something very urgent. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] If he doesn't
want to come down stairs again, he can send for you to come up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Beg pardon, m'm, but he was so very strong with
me that I shouldn't under any circumstances go to him, I don't
quite like to&mdash; [<i>He hesitates, embarrassed at having not to obey</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton's</span> <i>request at once.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Really, he made such a point of it! Oh, very
well then, you needn't go, Howes. [<i>With a nod of dismissal.</i>
<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>exits into ball-room and off</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Lowers her voice so that</i> <span class="smcap">Howes</span> <i>sha'n't hear her,
as he goes.</i>] Mr. Wolton is rather hard on the servants if they
fail to obey his orders to the letter. I'll go myself and see if he
won't see you. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>from ball-room, as her mother
starts.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Mother, where are you going with the favours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> To your father for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> But you can't; we need them. [<i>Crosses. Music stops.</i>]
I'll go for you. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>exits centre as</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>exits right</i>.
<span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>appears from ball-room, enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Come on, Rhodes, we need your help. [<i>Seizing</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> How long will it take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Oh, only a couple of minutes. [<span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>exeunt, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> [<i>Off stage.</i>] Mrs. Lorrimer! Mrs. Lorrimer! [<i>Enters.</i>]
Oh, Mrs. Lorrimer, won't you dance through with me?
[<span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>does this</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Do excuse me. [<i>Adds a little sotto voce and
coaxingly.</i>] And as a favour to me, go and take out poor Susie
Woodruff. You know it's only "snap the whip" figure, so
it won't make much difference to you if she is a bit heavy.
[<span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>makes a bored grimace, and goes up stage</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Lorrimer</span> <i>catches him</i>.] Yes, to please me! It isn't as if it were a
waltz and you had to get her around all by yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Very well, to please you! But Susan
Woodruff, she's the limit. [<i>Doubles up his arm and feels his
muscles meaningly, and exits.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>enters tragically. White,
frightened, she staggers quickly into the room and, stopping for a
second, gasps in a horrified whisper.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Mother! [<i>Crosses to arch.</i>] Mother!! [<i>Music, "Won't
You Come And Play With Me." Singing heard.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>turns,
frightened, goes down. Her mother comes to her. They meet.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Frightened, puzzled.</i>] What is it? What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>For a moment, can't speak. She opens her lips, but
the words refuse to come. Then she manages to gasp out:</i>]
Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Your father&mdash;what? [<i>Starts and looks at her
questioningly, frightened, as the music swells, and is joined in by
the voices of the dancers.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> He is dead!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Dead!! [<i>She makes a movement towards door.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>stops her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> It's too horrible!&mdash;he has killed himself&mdash; [<i>Adds
the latter in lower tone, almost fainting. The dancers appear in the
ball-room, hand in hand in single file, led by</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>, <i>and dance
wildly in&mdash;all singing "Won't You Come And Play With Me."
They make a big circle about</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>, <i>dancing out through the ball-room, the music and singing becoming fainter
as they disappear. The two women are left alone. Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>
<i>from ball-room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> May I go up? [<i>He sees the condition of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and the expression of</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] Is your mother ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Help me take her to&mdash;my room&mdash;I will tell you.
[<i>Dancers cross as they exit. Music changes to waltz. All go out.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>, <i>on end, drops their hands.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>shudder as they go out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Where is Mr. Rhodes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> He was here a moment ago. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.
<i>He has his overcoat on and carries his hat.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>turns</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Have you seen Mr. Rhodes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> He is just coming, m'm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>and seeing something in
his face and manner.</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>crosses hurriedly</i>.] Is there anything
the matter? Where is Mrs. Wolton? [<span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>enters
before</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>can answer</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>at once turns to him,
ignoring</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <i>who, on a run, bows slightly and exits</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> A most terrible thing has happened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> You must help me to get rid of all the guests!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> To get rid&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Mr. Wolton has committed suicide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Starts and shudders; speaks very rapidly.</i>]
Mr.&mdash;how awful! What are you going to do? You can't tell the
people now. What in the world did the man mean by not waiting
till the party was over! If it isn't like you men! Your own
comfort before anybody else's.&mdash;Well&mdash;the only thing is to
pretend it hasn't happened at all&mdash;make some excuse for Marion
and her mother&mdash;the guests needn't know anything about it,&mdash;and
finish the party!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Mrs. Lorrimer! Impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> It would be sort of uncomfortable for us who
know, [<i>She adds sincerely.</i>] &mdash;and the poor Woltons, of course,&mdash;it
is awful for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I thought if you spoke to Fanshaw and stopped
the cotillion and told a few of the guests&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Aghast.</i>] What! The truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> No, say Mr. Wolton has been taken suddenly and
most dangerously ill&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] Very well, I'll do what I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Stop! [<i>Music stops.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>goes to doorway into
ball-room and draws the heavy porti&egrave;res, shutting out the ball-room.</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>who stays at curtains.</i>] They are going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> They know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Not the truth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Mrs. Lorrimer is arranging it. [<span class="smcap">Footman</span> <i>off stage
calls</i> "43." <i>The numbers are repeated in another voice and farther
away. A moment's pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I wish I could comfort you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Smiling strainedly at him.</i>] Thank you. [<span class="smcap">Footman</span>
<i>calls</i> "56!&mdash;56!&mdash;89!" "32!&mdash;32!&mdash;61!" <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>holds back the
porti&egrave;re into ball-room</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I'd better go back to mother. How good you are
to us&mdash;believe me, I appreciate it all, Douglas, <i>all</i>. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>hurriedly. Shows excitement and emotion. At the same moment
enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>from ball-room at back. The two men speak the
word</i> "Marion" <i>at the same time, and turning, see each other.</i>
<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>also observes the presence of</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] Uncle Fred!
[<i>Crosses to him.</i> <span class="smcap">Footman</span> <i>calls</i> "115!"] [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.] You know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Gently, persuasively joining her.</i>] Why didn't
you send for me at once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Gentlemen, you will forgive me if I thank you
both and say the guests are leaving. The family would like
to be alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> I understand, but if I can be of any use?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Thank you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Shall we go, Fletcher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Good-night, Rhodes. [<i>Politely.</i>] My place is
here; it is my privilege to stay by Miss Wolton. [<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>looks
up, surprised</i>. <span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> <i>looks angry</i>. <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>continues, to</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] May I speak? [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>bows her head in assent</i>.] Mr.
Dawson, your niece has promised to-night to be my wife. At such
a terrible moment as this, I claim the right of membership of the
family, to be with you and help all I can. You will accept my
offices? [<i>Holding out his hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Shaking his hand.</i>] Certainly. You have won a
wife in a thousand. But you may be called on to do more perhaps
than you imagine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I am entirely at your service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Near doorway back, to all. At curtains, leaves curtains
open.</i>] Good-night! [<i>All turn slightly.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>bows and exits</i>.
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>going to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Watching them.</i>] Thank God! His money will
save them! [<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>enters; speaks softly to</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Mr. Dawson! [<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>starts, nods to</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>,
<i>who holds door open</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I'm coming. [<i>Slowly, seriously, meaningly.</i>] Fletcher,
I want a long talk with you to-night before you go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Very well, sir. [<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>sighs heavily and exits</i>.
<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>leaves door open. The two,</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>hear
the door shut behind them, and make a movement; they realize they
are alone. A heavy front door slams. Lights out. There is silence.

girl!&mdash;Cry, for God's sake, cry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>With an outburst.</i>] Oh, it is so horrible! [<i>She
sobs loud and hysterically in</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher's</span> <i>arms, her own arms about
his neck.</i>] &mdash;so&mdash;horrible&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="ACT_II" id="ACT_II"></a>ACT II.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>A church. At left are the steps leading to the chancel and the
chancel rails. Beyond the rails are palms, grouped, which
conceal the altar. Past the chancel, up stage, is the exit into the
choir. Down stage is the exit to the vestry and robing-room. To
right of centre begin the pews of the church on each side of a broad
centre aisle. The stage is set a little diagonally so that the aisle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
runs from upper right toward centre stage. This will make a
row or two more pews above the aisle than below it. White satin
ribbons are stretched above the aisle on each side, across the entrances
to the pews; this ribbon the ushers lift aside as they seat
the guests. The exit right is made by the centre aisle.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discovered.</span> <i>Three ushers,</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>, <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>.
<span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>is sitting in the first pew</i>, <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>standing
outside and leaning over its front, talking to</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>. <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>
<i>is leaning with his back against the side of the first pew across
the aisle up stage. They are dressed in long frock coats, with
buttonholes of white orchids. They are engaged in putting on
white kid gloves.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Is Fletcher in the vestry yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Heavens, no! How long do you want him to hang
around? But he won't be late; he's serious this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> I'm glad to hear it, because he's going to marry a
splendid girl. [<i>A short pause.</i>] I hope to goodness he really
loves her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Oh, he does, I'm sure. I'll bet you, if you like;
will you put up a silk hat on it? [<i>Rises.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Yes, I'll take you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> All right. [<i>Exit from pew. Holding out his hand
which</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>takes, and they shake.</i>] Done!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> And I hope I'll lose. And if I were he, I'd tremble
in my boots with a past like his, and the present getting so
conspicuously favourable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Oh, I don't believe in your boomerang pasts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> And I don't believe Fletcher can have one single
memory of his own which he wouldn't rather forget since he
has come to care for Marion Wolton. [<i>Crosses to pew.</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>
<i>crosses</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> Yes, but don't you think a fellow can sow his
wild oats and be done with them, and become a good man and
an honest citizen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Of course I do, else, good Lord, where'd I be!
We can't all be ideal chaps like Douglas Rhodes. But there
are oats and <i>oats</i>, and Fletcher's are&mdash;oats!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Well, he's sorry for them. [<i>Crosses to pew. As</i>
<span class="smcap">Douglas Rhodes</span> <i>enters,</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>exits.</i> <span class="smcap">Rhodes</span> <i>is also dressed
as an usher and comes up the aisle in time to hear</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone's</span>
<i>speech, as he joins them.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Who's sorry for what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Fletcher for&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Hum&mdash; [<i>He goes up left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> If he's <i>honestly</i> sorry, he's no business marrying
Marion Wolton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> He has a debt to be paid. He can't wash his
hands of the kind of things he's done; if he were in earnest in
regretting his old life, he would do something to make up for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Well, isn't he? He's going to marry a nice girl
and settle down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> If he were in earnest he'd marry, instead, one of at
least two girls I know of&mdash;not this one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Oh, come, there's no reason why he should do
a quixotic thing like that, he has a future before him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> He has their futures before him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Don't preach. Why should he be dragged
down&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] To where he dragged them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Exactly; Fletcher's no fool. And then there's
Mr. Dawson. He swears by Fletcher now; they're regular
pals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Ever since Mr. Wolton's death. I don't understand
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Coming down left.</i>] Yes, Dawson really believes
in Fletcher&mdash;well, perhaps he's right. There must be some good
in everybody, and perhaps Fletcher is just beginning to come
to the top. Let's hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> Hang it, fellows, brace up anyway. This isn't
a funeral, you know. Hello, there's the organ. [<i>Organ music
begins, and selections appropriate and usual on such occasions continue
uninterruptedly.</i>] The people will be coming now. [<i>He exits.</i>]
<i>Two other ushers make a movement, throwing off a certain lazy,
nonchalant manner, and getting themselves into more dignified
readiness for their duties.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Rises, crosses to left.</i>] I tell you, Fanshaw, this is
a hard day for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> But I'm glad you decided to come. It would
have made all sorts of gossip if you hadn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Sighs.</i>] Yes. Anyway, as it's got to be now, we
must all make the best of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> No one besides me dreams your life is still wrapped
up in Marion Wolton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Embarrassed, but pleasantly. With a half laugh.</i>]
And I suppose that ought to be some consolation, but I don't
know as it is. However, I shall never be able to thank you
enough for the comfort you've been. A man must have some one
to talk to. And it isn't every fellow who can have a friend like
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Embarrassed, but pleased.</i>] Shut up! Here's Fletcher's
mother; she came on from Richmond yesterday. [<i>He goes
down aisle to meet her.</i>] And behind are those girls they want put
into the front pews. [<span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>exeunt. At the
same moment that the two disappear,</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span> <i>appears on
the arm of the third usher,</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>, <i>as he shows her into the first
pew left.</i>] You know Mrs. Wolton, of course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimmins.</span> The bride's mother? [<i>Bows in affirmative.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher.</span> When she comes, won't you show her in
here with me, please? [<span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>bows and exits</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span>
<i>sits, then kneels a moment, and then reseats herself with a touch to
the trimming of the waist of her gown somewhere. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>
<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>, <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>with</i>
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span>; <i>ladies outside. Ushers exeunt as soon as guests are seated.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>On being shown into the first pew down stage.</i>]
Is this the farthest front you can seat us? [<i>In a dissatisfied tone.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Goes off right.</i>] This is the <i>front</i> pew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Of course, so it is. How silly of
me! [<i>She passes to the end of the pew nearest to the audience.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>As she follows into the pew, to</i> <span class="smcap">Johnstone</span>.] Are we
late?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johnstone.</span> [<i>Off left.</i>] No, you're awfully early. [<span class="smcap">Trimmins</span>
<i>off right</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Following into pew.</i>] Oh, I say, girls. Isn't that
a shame, we're early. [<i>The three women are standing in the
pew; they all turn around to glance back into the church, which
is supposed to be filling with guests, every once in a while some
one being seated by an usher in one of the pews visible to the audience.
After a glance round, the three sit down.</i>] What do you think
of Douglas Rhodes being an usher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, my dear, it doesn't take these men long
to get over a hopeless passion!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> If he is over it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude.</span> Of course he's over it, or he wouldn't be here,
would he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Every time I've tried to make love to him, he
has seemed to me awfully in love with her still. [<i>Laugh. Enter guests.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I was wondering this morning where in the world
Marion met Mr. Fletcher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Perhaps it was at that Christian thing-a-may-gig
she's interested in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You mean the Young Men's Christian Association?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Yes, I'd bet on it's being the Young Men's. [<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, my dear, you know he isn't that sort of a
man at all. He's much more my style!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Well, you know none of us ever met him till he began
to go to the Woltons. [<i>Enter ushers and guests. A new selection
is started on the organ and all half rise and turn, but turn back
again at once into their places complacently.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I think Marion's been getting to be a perfect stick
anyway, these last few years, with all the plain covered books
she reads and all her "university settlement" stuff in the slums,
and her working-girls' clubs and things. But that makes it all
the funnier for her to marry a man she's really not known very
long, don't you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude.</span> Where did he come from anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Everywhere&mdash;which you know is as good as nowhere.
He's that sort of a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, no, his family comes from Virginia. And
he's a Harvard man. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Trimmins</span> <i>with guest to pew.</i>] Was
in the fastest set there, so he must have some position! [<i>Laughs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> And he's rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> But Marion wouldn't marry for money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Then why is she marrying him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I don't know. I think she must be in love
with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>With a laugh.</i>] Ha! And then everyone says she's
so sensible! [<i>Door slams. Another different selection is started on
the organ and a door is shut off stage. The three women all half
rise and turn again.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Here they come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude.</span> No, not yet. [<i>The three sit again with a murmur of
disappointment.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude.</span> Well. I only hope Marion will be happy,&mdash;she's
taught so many others how to enjoy the best of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I don't see how you can sympathize with her in her
philanthropic fads! I believe in being charitable, but there's
a right and a wrong way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>Quietly.</i>] Yes, I don't suppose there's a fashionable
subscription list in town that hasn't your name on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> <i>Not one!</i> And as near the top as I can get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Leaning over to speak to</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.] I agree with
you! I went down to one of Marion's working women's evening
meetings&mdash;and, really, I was bored to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Isn't the church trimmed horribly; looks as if they
did it themselves. It would be just like Marion to have some
silly sentiment about it. [<i>Organ stops.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>Strongly.</i>] I like Marion for her sentiment. I only
hope she isn't marrying Fletcher because of it, in the hope
that she will make his life, and perhaps have to spoil her own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> [<i>Leaning over and speaking to the three women
in front.</i>] Doesn't the church look lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Who said it looked horridly.</i>] Perfectly lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Girls, who is that doddy looking creature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> [<i>Turning and looking back into the church.</i>] Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> On the left-hand side of the aisle with a last
winter's coat, don't you see, with the huge sleeves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, yes, with the cheap fur trimming and the mangy
muff&mdash;who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> Oh, that! It's one of the groom's country relatives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> She looks it. The kind that gets cards <i>only</i>
to the church. [<i>All laugh. They rise again, excitedly, showing an
increase of excitement over the first time they rose, and looking back.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Are they coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche.</span> No&mdash; [<i>General murmur of disappointment.</i>] It's
the bride's mother. [<i>All sit again.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>enters on the
arm of</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>. <i>She is very handsomely dressed in black velvet
and white lace. She is shown into the pew with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span>.
<i>They exchange greetings.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>exits, at the same time the</i>
<span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>enters behind the chancel rail and goes back behind the
palms, &amp;c. Meanwhile the following dialogue is taking place.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Leaning over.</i>] You mean how it doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> [<i>Half turning to look back.</i>] Susie Printly's Baltimore
cousin has just come in&mdash;do you think she's a beauty?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> You mean that <i>awfully</i> blonde girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughingly.</i>] Yes, that's she. Fifty cents the
small bottle, seventy-five the larger size! [<i>All three laugh. Short
pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I suppose you've heard she's engaged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No, to whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, only an American. [<i>Pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Weddings always give me a homesick feeling.
I like them so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Well, you've had your share of them, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Not at all. I've only been married <i>twice</i>.
Do you know who I have my eyes on now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No, who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> <i>Mr. Dawson!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> You're serious ... to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes! Everyone will tell you he's one of the
best men in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> But my dear, that's a change for you! How'll you
ever get him into the divorce court?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Nonsense! I don't want to. Haven't you
heard ... my house in Dakota's for sale. I don't belong to
the Divorce Club any more ... the membership is getting
entirely too mixed! [<i>They look back into the church at the people.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>leans over to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> I am so nervous I could almost cry out! Oh, I
shall be so relieved ... really, I can't tell you ... when
the ceremony's over. [<i>Organ. Wedding march.</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>and
his groomsman enter in front of the chancel rails. Guests all rise,
showing excitement and turning half-way face off the stage, looking
down the centre aisle.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span> <i>stand
facing the altar.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton's</span> <i>arm
affectionately and holds it tight in friendly sympathy. The faint
sound is heard of boys' and men's voices singing with the organ the
wedding hymn. All watch off the stage, as if following the slow
movement of a procession coming up the aisle. Meanwhile the following
dialogue occurs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> The Trimmins boys are the second ushers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Which is the one you were engaged to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I forget, I've flirted with them both so long, but I
think it's the right hand one! [<i>The head of the wedding procession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
appears. The choristers singing, followed by the six
ushers,</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>leading, followed by four bridesmaids.
The bride enters, leaning on the arm of</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Dawson</span>; <i>the
choristers exit, and continue singing off stage softly until time indicated
for them to stop. The bridesmaids and ushers take their
places, grouped properly about the chancel steps.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>stands
at the centre of chancel rail, where she is joined by</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>the
groomsmen standing to one side of him.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>stands on the
opposite side of</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>. <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>has come forward and
stands facing them on the other side of the chancel railing. The
guests open their prayer-books with a flutter of the leaves.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>gives bouquet to</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>. <i>Music stops for a moment.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Look! do you see how charming Mr.
Dawson appears by the chancel rails. I never saw him in a more
becoming place, and if it's a <i>possible</i> thing I shall make a rendezvous
to <i>meet</i> him there one day! [<i>Music begins again softly, and
accompanies the service. At first it is heard quite distinctly while the</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>is going through, unheard, the first part of the marriage
ceremony. A short pause in the dialogue.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Whispers to</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] How composed she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Whispering back.</i>] One would think she was
a widow! I couldn't do better myself! [<i>A short pause in the
dialogue.</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>looks up and raises his voice a little, addressing
the congregation in the church ... but not too loud so as to be too evident.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> "If any man ... [<i>A door is shut heavily off
stage. At sound of door slam,</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>exits and returns after</i>

overcome.</i>] can show just cause why these two persons should not
lawfully be joined together ... [<i>A commotion among the
guests, who turn away from the altar, to look back into the church.</i>] ... let
him now speak. [<span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>goes top of aisle, to
block the passage.</i>] or else hereafter forever hold his
peace...."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>enters, going to the foot of the chancel steps, cries</i>
"Stop!" <i>She is a young and attractive looking woman, fashionably,

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>With a gesture toward</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] <i>Ask him!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> What right have you to interrupt this ceremony?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>With a gesture as before.</i>] <i>Ask him!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> She has no right! [<span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>makes an exclamation
of denial aloud</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Swear that, Ned, swear it to me before this altar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Hesitates a moment.</i>] I swear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] Go on with the ceremony.
[<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>steps back to his place. The</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>takes up his
prayer-book.</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>comes up one of the chancel steps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Is there no one here to put this woman out? [<i>He
speaks to the groomsman.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>speaks to</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>, <i>who exits, and

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> Then do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> I will. [<i>She exits quickly.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>goes

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] Ask her for proofs! She won't

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.] No. I wish to speak to

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Looking up in his face for the first time, slowly.</i>]
Since you've known me have you been good and honest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Without any hesitation, looks back at her, honestly.</i>]
Yes. [<i>They hold this position for a moment.</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>leaves</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>. <i>She speaks after him, following.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> This is not <i>legal</i> proof, you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> It is not sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> But it's moral proof. [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>turns and goes
back to her place ... motions</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>to follow. He does so
but almost timidly.</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>turns from</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>.] Listen!
So long as he remains as he is, there's a chance that the world
won't always be able to fling my boy's shame in his face. And
I tell you, sir, the agony she would suffer now is nothing ... <i>nothing</i>
to what her life with him would be. And think what
it is to ... [<i>Her emotion racks her.</i>] watch your child, your
own flesh and blood, day and night, all its life, terror-stricken ... [<i>She
controls her emotions.</i>] lest you find some trace of
his father in him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] We are waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> But ... [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] I love him; I am not willing to
give him up for that woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> But she swears a compact of marriage was made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Has she proofs? [<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>glares at</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>; <i>his muscles grow rigid</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> <i>No.</i> [<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>relaxes</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Very well,&mdash;I have his word against hers,&mdash;that is
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clergyman.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] But I believe you do not deny
the child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Tentatively.</i>] Yes ... yes, I <i>do</i> deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] This man's past, sir, is not yours, nor
mine. But his present does belong to me, and his future shall
be mine too, to <i>make</i>, not <i>hers to mar</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Impatient.</i>] Come! We've lost enough time,
let's finish this. [<span class="smcap">Clergyman</span> <i>goes to his proper place behind the
chancel rails</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>Coming up one of the chancel steps.</i>] You shall
not go on with this marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Half angry.</i>] She has shown what she is by the
way she has chosen to stop it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> That's a cowardly lie! And it was only when I saw
by the papers that my letters had been useless that I decided
to humiliate myself in this way. Do you think I would so
degrade my womanhood for the sake of anything on God's
earth, but <i>one</i> ... my child? [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] Do you think I
could do anything but loathe <i>him</i>!... [<i>With a gesture toward</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> But I love him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> So did I <i>once</i>. And now I'd save you if I could
from all I know you'll have to suffer. Once you're his, he'll tire
of you....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] You forget one thing ... he is
going to place a wedding-ring on my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> Well, look at that! [<i>She rips her glove off violently,
and shows a wedding-ring.</i>] He placed it there! and said
he'd take me to a church and make our compact binding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Who has started, frightened, at first, has controlled
himself and speaks with intense quiet.</i>] This woman's from the
streets. She's up to all the tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>Outraged.</i>] How dare you! I am not what he
calls me! I swear that here in this holy place. <i>He</i> dragged me
through the streets, and any dirt upon my skirts <i>his</i> feet have
left there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Be silent. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] If you will not finish
the service, we will find some one who will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] No, I will not leave here till we
are married. I will not insult the man I have chosen for my
husband by doubting his word for hers. I won't believe he
made her what she is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Marion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Ned! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Clergyman</span>.] Go on! Go on with the
ceremony!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> You shall not go on! He's done his best to make
me what he says I am ... and God knows he might have
succeeded ... [<i>Emotion.</i>] but for my boy's sake I fought the
fight for honour ... [<i>Completely controlling her emotion.</i>]
The day he tricked me ... [<i>With a look of scorn at</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.]
I stood before him as pure a woman as you stand now, and
since he left me, there has never been an hour when I couldn't
look straight into my child's eyes, not one minute I couldn't
feel his two arms about my neck without a shudder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>More angry.</i>] I won't stand this!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>, <i>continuing in the same key and tone
as her former speech ... and pleadingly.</i>] <i>Don't</i> make vows
that will take away this innocent boy's name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You must answer to your child for his name and
honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Enraged, to</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>.] If you don't go now
I'll ... [<i>Stops himself.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> Before God, yours, [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] mine, ...
[<i>Clasping her hands on her breast.</i>] and <i>his</i> God [<i>With a look of
scornful warning at</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.], that man is <i>his</i> father, and <i>my</i>
husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>In a fearful rage.</i>] You lie! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Surprised ... pained.</i>] Sh-h ... go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> [<i>Coming between</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>she
cries out ... a wild, heart-broken, desperate cry.</i>] No! you shall
not write Bastard on the forehead of <i>my child</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Beside himself.</i>] By God! [<i>He strikes</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>
<i>a blow ... which sounds....</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>cries out and
recoils. The two mothers step forward with exclamations of fright
and anger.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>comes from the choir, brought by the sound of
the cry, and goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>. <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>falls when struck. The
child clings with both arms about its mother's waist.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>After a moment, drawing in a long breath, to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] Coward! [<i>Her uncle takes a step forward to her ... he
carries her wedding bouquet. She seizes it from him and dashes it
at the feet of</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>and then, throwing back her head with
an expression of scorn, turns from him, takes the arm of her uncle
with determination, and goes down the chancel steps out of the church.</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>stands crestfallen.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fletcher</span>
<i>look at each other, horrified, speechless.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ACT_III" id="ACT_III"></a>ACT III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>The library at the</i> <span class="smcap">Woltons</span>. <i>A handsomely and luxuriously
furnished room, somewhat disarranged by the preparations
for the wedding. It is here that the wedding presents are
displayed; along the two sides and partly across the end are placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
long and narrow improvised tables, covered with all sorts of gifts&mdash;silver,
glass, &amp;c. &amp;c. There are five piano lamps grouped together
at the upper corner of table. There are faded flowers about.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time.</span> <i>The following day.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Discovered. Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>at left of table, a maid and man
servant are busy wrapping up and addressing some of the wedding
presents.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Who has just finished writing an address on a
parcel.</i>] This is one to go by express, Howes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> [<i>Taking it.</i>] Yes, m'm. [<i>Placing it to one side
where are others tied up and addressed.</i>] Beg pardon, m'm,
but it's a great pity Miss Marion should lose a husband and
all the wedding presents as well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, it isn't always a pity, Howes, to lose a
husband&mdash;it's very often a very good thing. [<span class="smcap">Maid</span> <i>gives</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>another parcel to address, which she does&mdash;copying from
a card which the maid gives her with the parcel. Maid exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> [<i>Giving</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>a visiting card.</i>] This is
the address, m'm&mdash;still, if you'll excuse me for saying so, Mrs.
Lorrimer&mdash;if it was me, I'd keep the presents just by way of
a kind of consolation. [<i>She and the</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>tie up another box.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Addressing.</i>] Ah, but you see their associations
would be painful. I have had two husbands and I have
each time moved out of the house I occupied with each on the
day after losing him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> You know what trouble is, m'm, to have lost two
husbands. Grippe, m'm? [<i>Giving her another parcel.</i> <span class="smcap">Howes</span>
<i>to table up stage.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Not exactly. Another kind of epidemic.
The law, Howes. [<span class="smcap">Howes</span> <i>gives parcel.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>addresses
it from a visiting card. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Maid</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid.</span> I will tell Miss Wolton. [<i>Exit.</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>, <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>greet each other.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> How do you do? [<i>Shakes hands.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>motions with her head a dismissal to the</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <i>and he gets boxes and goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Goes to sofa and sits.</i>] Do you think Marion will see us?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I don't know, I'm sure. She is with her
mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> You don't mean&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, but she isn't a bit like she was yesterday.
She's crying like a child, poor thing,&mdash;what she's gone
through!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Have you seen the papers? [<i>Has large bundle of
them.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> It's in all of them, and some have big
pictures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Yes, my dear, with all of us in. Marion in a low-necked
dress. You're a sight, but my picture's rather good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Who has gotten papers from coat-tail pocket.</i>]
Perhaps you'd like to see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No, no; put them away quick. I'll see them
home. I take every blessed paper. [<span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>up to table where
he puts hat and papers</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> What are you doing&mdash;sending back wedding presents?
[<i>Crosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Oh, I say, is that necessary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I don't believe I would; there are lots of things she's
been dying to have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> My dear Ethel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Yes, why couldn't she&mdash;er&mdash;forget&mdash;er&mdash;overlook&mdash;er&mdash;any
old thing with some of them&mdash;I mean those she
wants? [<i>Turns up, looking at presents on table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, there are some things I should think
she'd be glad to send back. After all, twelve dozen oyster
forks are too many for a small family like a newly married
couple.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> How many sugar spoons did she get?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Thirteen, which to say the least, is an unlucky
number ... [<i>Rises, puts arm about</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>and comes
left.</i>] and there's that bankrupt stock of piano lamps. [<i>Crosses to
sofa; sits on sofa with</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>. <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>comes down.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Half laughing.</i>] That's true! By the way, have
you sent back Mrs. Bayley's presents yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Go on, tell her, Fanshaw. [<i>Rises and goes to centre.</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>sit on sofa.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Oh, it's nothing, only I sent it to
Mrs. Bayley myself three Christmases ago as a philopene. I
suppose she thought I wouldn't remember, but she forgot both
our initials are marked on the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>At table, examining presents. Laughing.</i>] Yes, my
dear, and Marion found them. People really ought to be more
careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Think of a woman with all Mrs. Bayley's
money&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> My dear, it is the rich who do these sort of things.
Every year all my second-hand Christmas cards and calendars
come from my wealthiest friends! And there's that thing&mdash; [<i>Lifting
a vase.</i>] Isn't it hideous? I don't know who sent it
but&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> <i>I</i> do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Innocently.</i>] Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Good gracious. [<i>Laughs.</i>] I assure you I haven't
any taste. [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>down centre.</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>rises</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> No, not a bit. [<i>Goes back of sofa and up to table.</i>
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>up stage by table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> How many presents did Marion get, anyway? [<i>Looking
among the things on the table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I don't know. [<i>Satirically.</i>] I didn't count
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I don't believe she got very many&mdash;Marion has always
taken up so many poor people. I'm sure I never can tell what
she sees in them! [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>crosses right of table</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh, yes, Ethel, I know how you choose your
friends. The other day I heard you were running after the
Lloyds&mdash;that settles it, I said&mdash;they are either going to have a
box at the Opera this year, or give a series of dinners, or a big ball.
Ethel knows what she's about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Exactly&mdash;Ethel knows her business, but you left
out one thing&mdash;they have the best cook in town, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Taking up a box with a large silver fish knife in it.</i>]
Who gave her this fish knife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> The Conrads, didn't they.... [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span>
<i>bursts out laughing</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Ha! ha! ha! If that isn't appropriate! You know
the old man Conrad made all his money out of imitation sardines!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> And very bad imitations, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, if I could make as much as Conrad, I'd
be willing to imitate codfish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Takes up a small box at which she has been looking.</i>]
Here's my present. I might as well take it home with me and
save you the trouble. [<i>Puts it in her pocket. She looks at silver
hand-glass.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Dryly.</i>] Thank you! Was that your present
in a Tiffany box&mdash;a small diamond pin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Yes, wasn't it sweet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Rather. I saw those pins marked down at
Wanamaker's Christmas time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> For heaven's sake, don't tell Marion. [<i>Re-enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Maid</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maid.</span> Mrs. Wolton will be down at once, madam&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Maid</span>
<i>exits at back.</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span> <i>crosses to table</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Who goes back to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] Wasn't it awful
yesterday&mdash;in the church! [<i>Crosses.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>With a sigh.</i>] Awful. [<i>Rises and crosses to
centre.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> [<i>Kneeling, with one knee on the sofa.</i>] Still, I will say
one thing, I've always been dying to have it happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Ethel! What a little beast you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Oh, she didn't mean to Marion particularly. Did
you, Ethel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> No; if I had my choice I'd rather see it happen to
Kitty; she's always pretending she's so sincere and all that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Marion is well rid of a man like Fletcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, I don't know&mdash;I believe I'd take him to-morrow
if he asked me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, I wish he would&mdash;it would serve you
just right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Oh, but you couldn't, to-morrow, even if he did
ask you&mdash;you forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, of course I did. My dear, I meant to tell you
when I came in that I'm announcing my engagement to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Good gracious, to whom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> To Mr. Fanshaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Good heavens. Allow me to condole&mdash; [<i>Crosses
to</i> <span class="smcap">Fanshaw</span>.] I mean congratulate you. And so you're
going to be married! [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>crosses. They shake hands.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Oh, no, only engaged for a little while,&mdash;just for fun.
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Good morning, Ethel. I'm going to ask you
to excuse Marion. She isn't seeing <i>any</i> one this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> I understand&mdash;of course&mdash;give her my love and tell
her not to mind&mdash;every one's on her side and,&mdash;she looked perfectly
lovely. Tell her she had the prettiest wedding dress anyway
of the season. [<i>She goes to kiss</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>, <i>who draws back.
Both</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>are aghast at the flippant
manner of</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>. <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>raises her eyebrows, shrugs her
shoulders.</i>] Good-bye, good-bye. Come along, Fanshaw.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> [<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.] Oh, Mrs. Wolton,
don't mind Ethel. She doesn't mean what she sounds like. She
never does mean what she sounds like. Besides, she's a little
rattled this morning. You see she's engaged again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Engaged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> Yes, not to Johnny. I'm it. [<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>re-enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span> Come along, Fanshaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanshaw.</span> All right, I'm coming. [<i>Takes up hat and papers.</i>
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span> <i>motions for him to leave papers&mdash;he does so and exits
with</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> How is Marion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> In the same extraordinary frame of mind&mdash;I'm
afraid she'll be ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> You mean, so composed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Yes, so hard&mdash;she hasn't shed a tear&mdash;the only
person she's at all human with is that poor creature upstairs.
And you know she's sent for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Surprised.</i>] She's going to see him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> She insists upon doing so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I wonder why? I never want to see any of
my husbands again&mdash; [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.] after they've
once disappointed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> I suspect&mdash;I don't know&mdash;Marion refuses to
talk about it, but her sending for this Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;Miss&mdash;er&mdash;dear
me, I don't know what to call her&mdash;but you know who I mean&mdash;I
think Marion has an idea she can help her to&mdash;er&mdash; [<i>She hesitates.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> You don't mean to marry Fletcher? [<span class="smcap">Mrs.
Wolton</span> <i>nods her head. Incredulously.</i>] She still wants to?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Anything for her child's future.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Very seriously reflecting.</i>] Well, I can understand
that. [<i>She rouses herself and finishes in her old manner.</i>]
But, my dear, I can sympathize with her, too, poor thing. I
know what's before her&mdash;you see, both mine were brutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Rises and crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] Will
you mind if I say something very frank to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Tentatively.</i>] Well&mdash;frank things are always
disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Anyway, I am going to run the risk. You know
you are considered&mdash;rather&mdash;er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I suppose you want to say heartless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well&mdash;then frivolous&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;and&mdash;a few other things&mdash;but
you aren't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> No, you're not.&mdash;These qualities are all only
on the surface. [<i>Both sit on sofa.</i>] They are the rouge and
powder of your character&mdash;underneath, I believe you are plain
and sincere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] I'm not so mad about being
plain, but sincere I would like to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> It's your wretched luck in your married life
that has made you what you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Sincerely, with much feeling, and almost
breaking down.</i>] You're right. It was a case of hardening my
heart and laughing in the world's face, or&mdash;or having it laugh in
mine perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> What you need now as you did in the beginning
is a good husband&mdash;like mine was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Good men don't grow on bushes, and besides,
good men don't seem to care about me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> I know just the man, and I believe he's been in
love with you for years, though he may not know it himself!
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>looks at her questioningly.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>goes
to her and, putting her arm around her neck, whispers in her ear.</i>]
I want you for a <i>sister</i>-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Embarrassed, pleased.</i>] Mrs. Wolton!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Call me "Laura," and I shall feel as if matters
had progressed a little. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>&mdash;<i>suddenly and unceremoniously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
Both women start slightly and exchange a quick,
covert, meaning glance. Rise.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Ah, Laura&mdash;I attended to that for you at once.
Has she come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Yes, she's upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Good. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>coughs</i>.] Mrs. Lorrimer&mdash; [<i>Shaking
her hand.</i>] I have followed you here&mdash;they told me
at your house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Rather hopefully.</i>] You want to see Mrs.
Lorrimer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Very quickly, aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>with humour.</i>] Say "Emily"&mdash;that may help a little, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> You want to see Emily?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>A momentary surprise at the name.</i>] Emily, sweet
name&mdash;er&mdash;yes, if you will allow me, alone. [<i>Goes right, takes
out handkerchief, and mops brow.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Alone!&mdash;very well! [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.]
I'd no idea it would come so soon. It must be <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Blushing.</i>] No, no, it's something else&mdash; [<i>Believing though that it is.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Still aside.</i>] One thing delights me, you're as
much in love as he is&mdash; [<i>Aloud.</i>] Good-bye, <i>Emily</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Aloud, with emphasis.</i>] Good-by, <i>Laura</i>!
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>exits</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Mrs. Lorrimer&mdash; [<i>Crosses centre.</i>] I want to
speak to you on a matter of the greatest privacy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes. [<i>Very quietly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> You are the only woman in the world who can
help me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Seriously.</i>] I consider that a true compliment,
Mr. Dawson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I hesitate because I do not know if I have the
right to ask you to share my secret with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> As far as I am concerned, I <i>give</i> you that right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> You will help me at no matter what inconvenience
to yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes&mdash;but I may not&mdash;er&mdash;consider it an
"inconvenience" to myself. [<i>Smiling.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Very well then&mdash;the terrible trouble of yesterday
is not the only calamity that may happen to my sister and
her daughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Rising&mdash;surprised, disappointed, but still
affected seriously by his serious manner.</i>] It is of them you wish
to speak to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> It is for them you wish my help?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>With one sigh, dismisses her disappointment
and holds out her hand&mdash;crosses to right of table.</i>] It is yours for
the asking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Thank you! [<i>Presses her hand.</i>] Mr. Wolton
killed himself to escape being convicted of a crime. [<i>Sits left
of table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Withdraws her hand slowly from his, and
whispers in tremulous surprise and horror.</i>] What!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> He had misappropriated funds entrusted to his
care,&mdash;exposure became inevitable&mdash;you know the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> But Marion, Mrs. Wolton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> They know nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Nothing! [<i>Looks puzzled.</i>] But how&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> The night of the catastrophe, Fletcher announced
his engagement to Marion, and claimed his right to bear a
share of the family's trouble. I took him at his word by asking
him to come to the rescue of his future wife's name and honour
with&mdash;money!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> And he did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes&mdash;willingly! He was splendid that night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> That's why you suddenly became his champion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes, I couldn't believe the tales against him, when
he had proved his love for Marion by such a big act of
generosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> He knows everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Everything, that same night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> And he has never breathed a word?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> That was only natural up to yesterday, but now&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> He doesn't threaten to tell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> He does, unless Marion marries him. He's mad
about her. The good in him has loved her up to now; now
it's the devil in him. He's not the same man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> And what do you want me to do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Advise me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> <i>I.</i> Advise <i>you</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes. Shall we tell Marion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> About her father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No, no! Not if we can help it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> But&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> And Fletcher must be paid every cent he
gave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Not easily done. Of course you will understand
I have nothing; what I had went at the first, and I shall need
all my income now for Laura and Marion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> You will borrow this money in your name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I have no security. [<i>A moment's pause; both think&mdash;rise.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Do you carry a life insurance? [<i>Crosses left.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Yes, quite a heavy one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Why not borrow on your life insurance this
sum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Pleased.</i>] Of course, of course! What a fool I've
been not to think of that! How clever you are! But again,
it must be borrowed privately for many reasons. [<i>Again a
moment's pause, while both think.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Showing decision and determination.</i>] I
think I know some one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Don't ask me till I've seen him and found
out&mdash;I will go now&mdash; [<i>Crossing up centre.</i>] &mdash;at once, and make a
beginning, and you must go to Fletcher and keep him from coming
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> That won't be necessary, for surely Marion wouldn't
see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> On the contrary she has <i>sent</i> for him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Astonished.</i>] She isn't still in love with him! I'll
go to him and say I've come to talk business; I think that's
the best way to put it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, and now, go right away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>With a world of appreciation and sentiment in his
voice and manner.</i>] <i>Without thanking you?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, please, because I don't want you to
thank me in a hurry&mdash;I want you to take a good long time over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
it. [<i>A moment's pause; they look at each other.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>seizes
her hand, half shamefacedly, and kisses it. He starts for hat, which
he placed on table as he entered.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Drawing him back&mdash;half shyly.</i>] Oh&mdash;answer
me just one question....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> A dozen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> What have you&mdash;a nice man&mdash;I mean&mdash;a
man like you.... [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] What kind of a man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> A "nice" man&mdash;you <i>are</i> a nice man, aren't
you? [<i>Smiling sweetly and rather archly at him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Embarrassed.</i>] Well&mdash;I&mdash;I'm afraid I shall have
to leave the answer with you&mdash;am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, I think you are&mdash;and why have you
never married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Well, you see, <i>some</i> people marry so often, some
others of us don't marry at all, just to strike a sort of balance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] That's mean of you to say to
me! Come, answer my question honestly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Well, I've only known one woman in the world who
wouldn't bore me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> There are such things as happy marriages,
aren't there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I should like to risk one, only&mdash; [<i>He hesitates and
stops.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> This "one woman in the world?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Oh, she's absurd, impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Why?...</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> She wants to divorce all her husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, but don't give her a chance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Don't give her a chance&mdash;any reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> By George! I never thought of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Delighted.</i>] You stupid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Delighted.</i>] Don't you know who I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Very self-consciously.</i>] No&mdash;how should I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Can't you guess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I don't want to guess, I want to know for
<i>certain</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> You are "the only woman in the world!" [<i>He bows
low before her, his right arm bent, his hand on his chest.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Takes his arm.</i>] Well, I am ready to run the
risk if you are. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>cross right.</i>] But
now we mustn't lose any more time&mdash;take a cable-car; I will, it'll
be quicker than a cab. Perhaps you won't approve of cable-cars
for me, though. They are the most emotional mode of convenience
I've ever tried.&mdash;This morning, in two curves I sat in three
men's laps!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> <i>Ah.</i> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Don't let those curves get to
be a habit, or I'll sue the company for alienating your affections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] Come! [<i>Takes his arm again
and they meet</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>, <i>who enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>As she comes.</i>] Tired out, Emily? [<span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>goes
up stage to door</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Tired! I never felt so rested in all my life!
I haven't tied up very many. [<i>With a look and gesture toward the
table of presents.</i>] I've been interrupted&mdash;and now you must
excuse me for a little while, but I'll come back and do some more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I'll go at once&mdash; [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] &mdash;an errand for
Emily&mdash;Mrs. Lorrimer. [<i>Emphasis on the name and a meaning
look.</i>] Good-bye&mdash; [<i>Going. Both women say</i> "Good-bye," <i>but</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>follows him.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion's</span> <i>back is turned.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Lorrimer</span> <i>quickly gives</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>a large bunch of violets she carries
in exchange for a small rose-bud he wears in his buttonhole. He
cannot get it into his coat. There is amused confusion.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>turns and</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>quickly exits.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>down left of
table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Right of table.</i>] It's like the death of someone, isn't
it? This is the death of my marriage, and these gifts are its
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Has&mdash;er&mdash;she gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No&mdash;she's waiting up in my room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Quietly.</i>] I mean to make him marry her if I can,
here, to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Doubtfully.</i>] Do you think you can?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> If he loves me, I think so. I shall ask him to prove
his love by doing the one honourable, honest thing there is for
him to do. [<i>To sofa.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> You believe in this woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> He has practically acknowledged that what she says
is true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Tenderly.</i>] And <i>you</i>, dear, and your love&mdash; [<i>Crosses
to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>. <i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> <i>My</i> love&mdash;for <i>him</i>. [<i>Sits on sofa</i>.] The blow he
struck Jeannette fell on my heart and killed my love. A man
who would strike a woman will do most anything,&mdash;and think
where he did it, and <i>why</i>? Because she was pleading and fighting
for the rights of his child!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I am glad, dear, you can take it so calmly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Calmly.</i>] Oh, no, it isn't exactly that&mdash;I am
reasonable; I see I've escaped a great misery and I'm grateful&mdash; [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Servant</span>.] But I suffer terribly, for the moment I
close my eyes, I see only the dreadful scene of yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Mr. Fletcher, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Oh! He's missed him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> What? [<i>Rises.</i>] Who's missed who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Nothing. Nobody!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>.] Show him in, Howes. [<span class="smcap">Servant</span>
<i>bows slightly and exits</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] Let me go the other way. [<i>Reaches
door.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You're coming back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes. [<i>Kisses</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> What a sweet rose that is. [<i>Touching</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson's</span>
<i>rose in</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer's</span> <i>dress.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Yes, it's the loveliest rose I've ever seen.
[<i>Exit quickly as</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Speaking seriously but pleasantly, evidently expecting
that everything is to be made all right between them.</i>] Thank
you for sending for me, but I would have come without your
message!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Looks at him, surprised at his tone. Speaks quietly.</i>]
Jeannette is upstairs waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Starts; his whole manner changes; he realizes now
that he has to fight for what he wants and against what he doesn't
want.</i>] Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I've promised her you shall marry her, if I can
make you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> You can't. No, no, Marion. [<i>Pleading.</i>] You
won't throw me over for yesterday. I lost my temper, I know,
and I'm sorry for it, but I love you&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Interrupting.</i>] Prove it by doing what I ask.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Angry.</i>] Never! [<i>Goes right.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Follows him.</i>] If you make the reparation there is
in your power, it would save you from being utterly contemptible
in my eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> <i>You</i> say that!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes,&mdash;will you do what I ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Angry.</i>] No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Angry.</i>] Then I do <i>right</i> to despise you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> No, because it is <i>my love</i> for <i>you</i> that keeps me
back. [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>laughs a bitter, satirical laugh</i>.] I will marry
only <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Me! Ha! [<i>Laughs again.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Angrily&mdash;close to her.</i>] And I <i>will</i> marry you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No, you'll not! [<i>Faces him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I will <i>force</i> you to marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> How dare you to take that tone with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I dare more than that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Goes to bell.</i>] Take care, or I'll have the servants
turn you out of the house! [<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>laughs an ironical laugh.</i>]
<i>Will</i> you marry Jeannette Gros!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>More angry.</i>] No! [<i>He follows her.</i>] And I
won't leave this house, either. [<i>Takes her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Don't touch me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I won't leave the house because it's <i>mine</i>. And
so will <i>you</i> be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Yes, you will, because I'll buy you with your
father's reputation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> With what!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> With your father's good name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You&mdash;scoundrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> We are well mated, for you are the daughter
of one! [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>immediately touches the bell, which is heard
ringing in the distance</i>.] You had better dismiss the servant when he
comes; I am sure you would rather he didn't hear all I have to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Almost under her breath.</i>] <i>You</i> cannot injure my
father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Ask your uncle, Mr. Dawson! [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>looks
up questioningly, as if she suddenly remembered something.</i>
<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Ask Mrs. Wolton to please come here at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> Yes, m'm. [<i>Crosses room and exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> You remember the night of your fancy-dress ball
and your father's&mdash;death&mdash; [<i>He pauses</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>doesn't
answer, but looks troubled.</i>] He took his life to save it from
being&mdash;disgraced, because he was a <i>thief</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Stop! [<i>She draws herself up and looks</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>
<i>in the face. He stops. She goes to door left and opens it. He
goes right. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>, <i>a little frightened.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>takes her hand and leads her down stage.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>but does not bow.</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>bows.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton's</span> <i>hand and the two women stand, facing</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>
<i>who stands.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You repeat, if you dare, the vile slander of my
father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Your father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> All that I said is true, and more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> What is true? What did he say? [<i>A pause.</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>remains doggedly silent.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Ah! You daren't repeat it before my mother!
[<span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>sneers</i>.] You know she would prove the lie in your
face! Did you think you would frighten me into marrying you!
Do you think a man with a reputation like yours, could injure
the reputation of a man like my father, loved by everyone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> And who cheated those very people who loved
him&mdash;that's only what <i>I</i> did. He was no better than I&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Mrs.
Wolton</span> <i>makes a movement and an effort to interrupt him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span>.] Let him finish, mother.
[<i>Holding her back.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> He left you both beggars, and robbed his own
sister besides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> <i>It is not true!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Not believing him.</i>] How is it, then, that we have
everything, everything we could wish for! How is it we have
lived in our old home, lived our old life, if we were beggars!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> How?&mdash;thanks to <i>my</i> money, <i>I've</i> paid for it all!
[<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>opens her lips to speak, but cannot; a short pause</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> You! [<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>stops her with her hand on her
arm.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>cross to sofa.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Quietly.</i>] It is true! This is <i>my</i> house you're
in! [<i>A pause&mdash;the two women are stunned, speechless, unable to
comprehend and believe, yet unable to contradict. Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Ah! [<i>Relieved, as</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>is his proof.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>,
<i>looking from one person to the other, realizes the situation. He looks
a little frightened at the two women. An awkward moment's pause.</i>]
Question <i>him</i> if you doubt my word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> My father! Is what he says true? [<i>The women are
afraid to question.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] Have you told them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> The truth? <i>Yes!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] Your reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I didn't come here to do it; she made me angry.
She drove me to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>In a hard, tuneless voice.</i>] He says my father was
not honest&mdash;is that <i>true</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Answers with difficulty.</i>] Yes. [<i>A sob comes into</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion's</span> <i>throat and she almost breaks down, but she at once
controls herself.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> He says <i>his</i> money has been supporting us since&mdash;since&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] A <i>manly</i> way to put it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Crosses left. Bursting out again.</i>] I wanted you
to feel an obligation to me&mdash;I don't want to lose you.&mdash;You
loved me yesterday; if you were once bound to me, you'd love
me again&mdash;you can't change like that over night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> If yesterday had left any love in my heart for
you, you would have destroyed it by what you have done to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Who has gained control of herself.</i>] But I don't
understand how it was his money&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Interrupts.</i>] At the time of your husband's death
a large sum of money was needed to keep his wrong-doing
from being made public. I took Fletcher into my confidence,
and he lent us this sum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You should have <i>told</i> me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I wanted to save you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No! no! It was placing me in a terribly false position.
It was placing all of us! Well, <i>I</i> take the debt now on
<i>my</i> shoulders! Between us three we will manage to pay it up
in time&mdash;I am ready to give up the rest of my life to it. [<i>Crosses
to</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] Don't be afraid, you will be paid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> And you still persist in your refusal to marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes! Yes! Yes!! A thousand times now more than
ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> And do you think all those years you are trying
to scrape up the money, I'll hold my tongue? I don't care
about the money, I only care about you.&mdash;If I can't have you,
do you think I'm going to accept the disgrace you helped heap
upon me yesterday? Not I, if I know it! Throw me over,
and I'll make public your father's record&mdash;every dishonest bit
of it! [<i>Strikes table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Cries out.</i>] No! No! [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> You dare threaten?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> No, no! He can't mean it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> [<i>Taking</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson's</span> <i>arm.</i>] No, no! He wouldn't
bring this disgrace upon us! What good would it do him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Then persuade her to marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> No. Rather the disgrace!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] I never thought I would humble
myself before you, but I do, now, and I beg you, for the love you
say you have for me, spare the name of a man, who at least
never harmed you! Don't dishonour my father's memory. Isn't
it enough revenge for you that my mother and I know it! [<i>With
tears.</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>is a little affected, but</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>does not see this,
and interrupts. He pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>away from before</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> No&mdash;I won't have you pleading to him! [<i>Places
her to left and</i> Marion <i>puts arms about her mother.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> I know who I have to thank for all this&mdash;Rhodes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> There is no need to mention his name. [<i>Arms
about her mother.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Isn't there! It was he who brought Jeannette
here&mdash;it was he we both have to thank for yesterday's ordeal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>, <i>half-heartedly.</i>] What? [<i>She places</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>on sofa.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> You didn't believe me when I told you of your
father! But this is as true as that was. And the night you
promised to marry me, Rhodes threatened to do this very thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> It isn't possible! He wouldn't have submitted me
to yesterday's humiliation!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> How else could she&mdash;living quietly in a little
town in Switzerland&mdash;know of our affairs here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I confess Rhodes tried to prejudice me, but I was
too much impressed with Fletcher's generosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> That money was nothing. I'd do it all over again
to-morrow if Marion would only marry me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Douglas tried to influence me, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> He wants you himself, that's why!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>In despair.</i>] Then I have no one&mdash;no friend to
believe in! Not even you, Uncle Fred, for you should have
told me about my father in the beginning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] You have me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Oh! Can't I make you understand, <i>you</i> least of
all! [<span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>enters and announces</i>&mdash;"Mrs. Lorrimer&mdash;Mr. Rhodes." <i>Those on the stage look up surprised.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Oh! this is more than I will bear! Mr. Rhodes,
I must beg you to excuse us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> To excuse you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> I have brought Mr. Rhodes&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> Then, I must ask you to take him away if he is
unwilling to leave without you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> No, Laura, wait&mdash; [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Mother is right. It should have been enough for
Mr. Rhodes to have witnessed our humiliation yesterday. It is
adding another insult for him to come here to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Marion, you don't know what you're
saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Stops</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>.] No! Miss Wolton is
doubtless right&mdash; [<i>Movement from</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] You did not
tell me Mr. Fletcher was here, or I shouldn't have been persuaded
to come. I prefer to go&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> No, not without my telling why you came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> No, I must ask you to keep the reason entirely
to yourself&mdash;and Mr. Dawson. [<i>Starts to go.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Stops him.</i>] Not yet. I understand now why you
have come with Mrs. Lorrimer. It is not fair that your reason
for coming should not be known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> We know it; Miss Wolton has sufficiently explained.
His presence here at this moment is only another insult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Oh, you wish me to go? [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span> <i>begins to
cross back of</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>to right of table.</i>] That puts another colour
on the matter. I am at a loss to imagine how Mrs. Wolton
could accuse me of the sentiments she did. I will stay and
wait for an explanation from her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> I will give it to you if you will excuse me for a
moment. [<i>Going.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Meeting her.</i>] What are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Bring her here&mdash;she is in my room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Uneasy.</i>] Jeannette!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Ignoring</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, <i>speaks to</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>in reply to</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher's</span> <i>question.</i>] She will tell us who brought her to New
York, and that will answer&mdash;Mr. Rhodes. [<i>She exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.] I refuse to remain to see this
woman. [<i>Takes his hat.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I have no wish to detain you&mdash;but kindly give your
address that I may communicate with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> My bankers you know,&mdash;that is all that is necessary,
as I shall very likely sail&mdash;what day is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> [<i>Bitterly.</i>] Oh, yes, of course, my wedding-day
was on Thursday! I think I shall sail in to-morrow's steamer.
[<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>re-enters. Sees</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>going, her voice stops him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> You are going&mdash;wait. This gentleman has asked
me a question, which I think you can answer for me, by answering
a question of mine to you. How did you know of my marriage
to&mdash;of my marriage of yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> From a friend who wrote me and sent me the
newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Meaningly.</i>] A man or woman friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> A woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Starts&mdash;it is the first shock of doubt she has had.</i>]
Douglas Rhodes had nothing to do with your appearance yesterday
in the church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Astonished&mdash;hurt.</i>] <i>You thought that?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> Oh, no, Miss Wolton, he had nothing in the world
to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Stands up as if shot, her face full of shame and
grief&mdash;turns slowly toward</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>bows her head, half whispers.</i>]
I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>.] You see you were wrong, Mr.
Fletcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Possibly. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton.</span> And our secret, my husband's&mdash; [<i>Hesitates,
searching for a word&mdash;does not finish.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fletcher.</span> Oh, I was only trying to bully your daughter into
marrying me&mdash;a drowning man, you know&mdash;I thought I could
make her love me again if I once had a good chance&mdash;that's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
all. Well&mdash;I've bought lots of pleasure at the cost of other
people's; now I'm going to pay my debt, I suppose, with some
misery on my own account, but&mdash;well,&mdash;I sha'n't disturb Wolton's
memory. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>whispers aloud to herself involuntarily&mdash;</i> "Thank
God!" <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>continues speech.</i>] Because,
because&mdash; [<i>A sob comes in his throat.</i>] I can't help it, I
still love his daughter. [<i>After a long look at</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>, <i>exits.</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>has turned from</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>and listened to the end of</i>
<span class="smcap">Fletcher's</span> <i>speech. As he goes</i>, <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>involuntarily seizes</i>
<span class="smcap">Marion's</span> <i>hand.</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>frees herself from</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>with an
encouraging look at her, and follows</i> <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> <i>out.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> Well, bad as he is, there is something about
that man that takes right hold of me. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>.] It's lucky
I've fallen in love with you, or I might have had one more
inning in the divorce club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> I'm only afraid there's a little danger of you trying
it again, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> With <i>you</i>? Oh, no! The day we are married
I'm going to begin writing letters to the newspapers in favour of
abolishing the institution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Enters.</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>goes to her quickly, calm and
hopefully.</i>] Go to him, he is waiting. [<span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>gives an
exclamation of emotional relief and joy.</i>] Be tactful; he wants to
sail on to-morrow's steamer&mdash;don't ... [<i>Interrupted.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> I understand&mdash;he shall sail alone, if he will only
leave his name behind for my boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> That he will do&mdash;he said so. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>turns</i>,
<span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>takes her hand and leaves the room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer.</span> [<i>Crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] Now, Marion, I want
you to know why Douglas came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Rises, comes center.</i>] Please&mdash; [<i>He shakes his
head.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> But she <i>must</i> know some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Not before me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> Have you forgotten, Marion, our debt to Fletcher?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> [<i>Realizes what it is. To</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] <i>You</i> would&mdash;Oh
no, rather leave the debt with him to repay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Because I owe you now more than I can ever repay,
for the wonderful friendship you have given me all my
life! I haven't the right to accept anything more from you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> Let me be the judge of that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Still, after all that's gone by, you don't hate me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>Forgetting himself.</i>] Hate you? No. I&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Marion</span>
<i>crosses to sofa, sits.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>, <i>as he begins to
speak, has touched</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson's</span> <i>arm meaningly.</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span> <i>moves
quickly and softly to</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>, <i>and, with a quiet, soft, firm touch on
his arm, stops him before he can say "I love you."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawson.</span> [<i>Aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>.] Wait&mdash;trust to me who love
you both, and wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span>.] You'll leave the debt with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion.</span> Yes! [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Lorrimer</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wolton</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dawson</span>
<i>all exchange happy, hopeful glances.</i> <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marion</span> <i>look at
each other.</i></p>
